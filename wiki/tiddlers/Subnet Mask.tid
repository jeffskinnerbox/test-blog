title: Subnet Mask
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

For IPv4, a network is also characterized by its subnet mask,
which is the bitmask that when applied by a [[bitwise|Bitmask]] AND operation to any [[IP address|IP Address]] in the network,
yields the routing prefix.
Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address.
For example, 255.255.255.0 is the network mask for the 192.168.1.0/24 prefix.

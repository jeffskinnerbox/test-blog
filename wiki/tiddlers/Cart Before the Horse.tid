I have heard many a argument over WiFi vs. ZigBee or CoAP vs. [[MQTT]] vs. [[XMPP]],  and they often seem totally unproductive.
For me, these discussions seem to start in the middle of the analysis and miss an important point.
The combatants must first declaring which [[IoT Architectural Patterns]] they are considering,
and only then they may arrive at a consensus on solutions.

A microcontroller (sometimes abbreviated ÂµC, uC or MCU) is a small computer on a single integrated circuit containing a processor core, memory, and programmable input/output peripherals.
Microcontrollers are designed for embedded applications, in contrast to the microprocessors used in personal computers or other general purpose applications.
By reducing the size and cost compared to a design that uses a separate microprocessor, memory, and input/output devices, microcontrollers make it economical to digitally control even more devices and processes.

 It differs form normal desktop or laptop computers in that a microcontroller is an application specific computer that usually runs a single program performing dedicated task(s) while the the later two are general purpose computers that can run numerous programs depending on a users needs.
A microcontroller contains on chip CPU, input/output interface, memory, clock, timer, and an assortment of of other peripherals.

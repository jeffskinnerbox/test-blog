title: Routing
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Every TCP/IP packet, whether itâ€™s a client request or a server response, contains a source [[IP address|IP Address]]
and a destination IP address.
Routing is the process of determining the network path a packet should
take from the source IP to the destination IP.
Most routing is managed automatically by properly
configured routing software and hardware.

The process of auto-configuring routes is called [[Dynamic Routing]], and is accomplished through the
exchange of routing information packets among systems on the network.
The [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP)
and [[Border Gateway Protocol]] (BGP) are examples of Internet routing protocols.

Each network is configured with a [[Default Gateway]];
the network sends all packets with destination
IPs that are not directly connected to the local network to the default gateway for forwarding to the
final destination IP.
The assumption is that the default gateway will know how to reach any network
that the system itself cannot reach through one of its own interfaces.

Routing errors can occur for many reasons.
A principal situation is when a packet cannot be routed to its destination IP address because the network segment that contains
the destination IP is not bound to any of the directly connected
network interfaces and the default gateway does not know how to reach the destination.
In such cases, we need to define a path through which the
packet can be delivered to its destination.
We do this by manually defining [[Static Routes]] on one or more systems.

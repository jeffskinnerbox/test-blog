title: Mashup
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki


A mashup is a web page, or web application, that uses content from more than one source
to create a single new service displayed in a single graphical interface. 
The term implies easy, fast integration, frequently using open APIs and data sources to produce
enriched results that were not necessarily the original reason for producing the raw source data.

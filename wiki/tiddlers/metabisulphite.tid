type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Refers to sodium or potassium metabisulfite, a chemical that is highly 
effective at killing wild yeast and bacteria by releasing sulfur 
dioxide in the vessel - be sure to let it escape via an airlock.

For the limits and precautions of potassium metabisulfite,
see the [[Wine Academy web site|http://winemakersacademy.com/potassium-metabisulfite-wine/]].

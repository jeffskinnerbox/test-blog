title: Onion Router
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

[[Tor|https://www.torproject.org/]]
is a network of virtual tunnels, using
[[onion routing|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onion_routing]],
that allows people and groups to improve their privacy and security on the Internet.
The Tor network disguises your identity by moving your
traffic across different Tor servers,
and encrypting that traffic so it isn't traced back to you.
Anyone who tries would see traffic coming from
random nodes on the Tor network, rather than your computer.

type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

ESSID is one of two types of [[Service Set Identification (SSID)]]:

* In an [[ad hoc wireless network|Ad-Hoc Mode]] with no access points, the [[Basic Service Set Identification (BSSID)]] is used.
* In an [[infrastructure wireless network|Infrastructure Mode]] that includes an access point, the ESSID is used, but may still be referred to as SSID.

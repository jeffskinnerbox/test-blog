The [[coherer|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherer]]
is a primitive form of radio signal detector used in the first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Coherer had many short comings as a detector and
around 1905 will be replaced by the Fleming Valve (aka Diode Vacuum Tube)
and De Forest's Audion (aka Triode Vacuum Tube).
For more information, see Kathy Balistreri excellent videos on the [["Secret History of Electricity"|https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYrX5FiWjiPd0JytMh6NX1Q]].

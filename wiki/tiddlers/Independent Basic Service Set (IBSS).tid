title: Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Within 802.11,
one can set up an [[ad hoc network|Ad-Hoc Mode]]
of client devices without a [[controlling access point|AP Mode]];
the result is called an IBSS (independent BSS).
This is in contrast to a [[Basic Service Set (BSS)]].

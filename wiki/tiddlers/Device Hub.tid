title: Device Hub
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Device hub or sensor hub are defined as any processor that takes in and compute sensor
data to avoid using a device’s application processor
or microcontroller if it’s a smaller device. 
This technology can help off-load these jobs from a product's main application processor,
thus saving battery consumption and providing a performance improvement.

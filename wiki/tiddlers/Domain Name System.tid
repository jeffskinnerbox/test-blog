title: Domain Name System
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical distributed naming system for computers, services,
or any resource connected to the Internet or a private network.
It associates various information with a [[Domain Name]] assigned to each of the participating entities.
Most prominently, it translates domain names, which can be easily memorized by humans, to the numerical [[IP addresses|IP Address]]
needed for the purpose of computer services and devices worldwide.
The Domain Name System is an essential component of the functionality of most Internet services because it is the Internet's primary directory service.

When implementing DNS on a network,
itâ€™s important to implement some separation between external and internal Domain Name Services.
The DNS server needs to be configured to handle both external and internal [[IP Address]] resolution.
External IP addresses are typically resolved via
[[DNS Forwarding]] to an external DNS server.

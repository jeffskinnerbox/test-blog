title: Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) / VHSIC Hardware Description Language (VHDL)
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

A field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit designed
to be configured by a customer or a designer after manufacturing â€“ hence "field-programmable".
The FPGA configuration is generally specified using a hardware description language (HDL),
similar to that used for an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC).

PSoC (Programmable System-on-Chip) is a family of microcontroller integrated circuits by Cypress Semiconductor.
These chips include a CPU core and mixed-signal arrays of configurable integrated analog and digital peripherals.

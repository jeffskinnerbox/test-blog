!Quantified Self Movement
The origin of this, not so small piece of pseudo-analysis,
is my curiosity about the 
"quantified self movement" and its relationship with the Internet of Things.
Quantified Self movement employs technology to develop self-awareness by tracking data related to exercise,
diet, health maintenance, financial management, learning and so forth.
Some of this data could be captured from social media interactions
but the most interesting data will come from sensors we wear or embedded in device we use.

[[Another definition|http://www.livescience.com/topics/quantified-self/]] I found for the quantified self movement is:

//The quantified self movement aims to measure all aspects of our daily lives with the help of technology.
Wearable devices such as activity trackers, along with apps that let us log our every step, snack and snooze could bring us a better understanding of ourselves, our nature, and may even benefit our health.//

I will not pass judgement how real this "movement" is,
nor how much valuable it really has for all of us,
but I wanted to get a sense of how many IoT type gadgets are out their trying to quantify our lives.
This topic is interesting in it own right but
it seems to me this will have significant importance to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT).
If we are quantifying our lives, surely the social media world will love to harvest this data for its use.
But beyond things like Facebook and Twitter, the Industrial Internet could leverage these gadgets
to provide services.

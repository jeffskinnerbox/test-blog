title: Service Abstraction
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

Service abstraction helps insulate the implementation and infrastructure details from service consumers.
It provides a single behavior to be experienced by the service consumer even when the underlying components,
such as IoT devices, low level sensors, electronics, may not be heterogeneous.

They also may hide from the service consumer filtering and algorithmic processing of data that creates new information that is provided to the service consumer.

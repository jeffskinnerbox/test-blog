Web 2.0 describes World Wide Web sites that use technology beyond the static pages of earlier Web sites. 
Although Web 2.0 suggests a new version of the World Wide Web,
it does not refer to an update to any technical specification,
but rather to cumulative changes in the way Web pages are made and used.

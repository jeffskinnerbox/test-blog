title: What's the matter with WiFi?
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

WiFi is both power hungry and made for big data.

Z-wave is controlled by one company.
Bluetooth is low-power,
but while the standard is being tweaked to accommodate a more mesh-like structure,
itâ€™s not a true mesh network.
ZigBee has a range of issues, but suffers in part because it has
so many variations that the standard is not as standardized as consumers would like.

To address these perceived flaws and others,
the Thread networking protocol supports IPv6 using 6LoWPAN,
which is a way to adapt the heavier IPv6 capability for a power-and-packet constrained network.
It also can support a mesh network of 250 devices or more.
This may seem like overkill,
but if you tally every light bulb in your home, every outlet,
every switch and then start adding sensors and fun devices,
that number starts making sense.

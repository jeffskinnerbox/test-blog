A microprocessor incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC) or at most a few integrated circuits.
A microprocess is a general-purpose digital computer central processing unit. To make a complete micorcomputer, you add memory (ROM and RAM) memory decoders, an oscillator, and a number of I/O devices. The prime use of a microprocessor is to read data, perform extensive calcualtions on that data, and store the results in a mass storage device or display the results.

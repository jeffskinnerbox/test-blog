# Authors
This web site was created by the static site generators [Pelican][03].
The Pelican Theme you see is based on [pelican-bootstrap3][01],
and its primary authors are:

- [Daan Debie](https://github.com/DandyDev) aka `DandyDev`
- [Magnun Leno](https://github.com/magnunleno) aka `magnunleno`
- [Hilmar Lapp](https://github.com/hlapp) aka `hlapp`
- [mwcz](https://github.com/mwcz)
- [Sebastian Kempken](https://github.com/skempken) aka `skempken`
- [Sagar Behere](https://github.com/sagarbehere) aka `sagarbehere`
- [Romulo Jales](https://github.com/romulojales) aka `romulojales`
- [Mike Abrahamsen](https://github.com/mikeabrahamsen) aka `mikeabrahamsen`

Also, the concept of using IPython Notebook as an integral part of this blog
was inspired by the blogs of:

- [Carl Boettiger](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/09/28/Welcome-to-my-lab-notebook.html)
- [David Ketcheson](http://www.davidketcheson.info/2012/10/11/blogging_ipython_notebooks_with_jekyll.html)
- [Ben Morris](http://www.bendmorris.com/2013/05/blogging-with-ipython-distances-in.html)
- [Fernando Perez](http://blog.fperez.org/2012/09/blogging-with-ipython-notebook.html)

In addition, the [personal wiki][05] (or [MicroContent][06] as I call it on the website)
makes use of the excellent personal Wiki called [TiddlyWiki][07] created by [Jeremy Ruston][08].

These major components, and many minor additions, was integrated together by Jeff Irland
to create the theme and overall
function you see within the website [Jeff's Skinner Box][02] and stored on [GitHub][04].
It was initially create circa April 2014 and has undergoing continuous modifications ever since.

# Where is My Stuff?  Is My Stuff OK?

## Introduction
Many companies are creating the raw sensors to capture data.
Many companies are creating **IoT SaaS data analytic tools.
Many companies are creating **IoT solution** for specific business problems.
Many companies are attempting to create useful **IoT PaaS** offerings to help create these IoT solutions.
Many companies are creating **IoT SaaS data analytic tools.

IoT is about convert raw data to actionable information.
Actionable information is being used directly by its creator for business optimazation, new service offerings, or ehance the user experiance.

But no company is laser focused on creating the foundational informational services needed: Visibility Services.

So what is Visibility?

1. Location:  Where, exactly or approxamately, is my stuff?
2. Specificity:  What is this stuff exactly? What is its color, size, expiration date, etc.?
3. State:  Has my stuff been in the proper environment?  Is it in a safe/good condition?
4. Compliance:  Has my stuffed meet all relevant quality gates, regulatory, trade, and documentation requirements?
5. Integrity:  Has my stuff been breached or compromised in any way?
6. Authenticity:  Is my stuff exactly the thing it is supposed to be?

>I believe in the not too distant future, we will be able to inexpensively
track and status nearly anything we care about.
We will have near real-time answer to “Where is my stuff” … “Is my stuff OK”.
We’ll not only be able to locate our car, pet or cell phone,
but our pizza delivery or the power tool we loaned to the neighbor.
This will come about because of convergence of emerging location technologies,
low power wireless devices, ubiquitous networks, web-based services and standards.
Today we have service providers, service like voice & data from telecos, that are critical enablers.
In the near future we will have “visibility Service Providers”
who understand that visibility isn’t just data but an assurance to their customer
to answer the questions “Where is my stuff” … “Is my stuff OK”.

There are a number of different RTLS technologies and solutions to be aware of:

Infrared RTLS works the same way as your television remote. An infrared tag (i.e., a remote) placed on an asset flashes a unique infrared ID at a fixed interval, which is picked up by a ceiling-mounted infrared reader (i.e., a TV).
WiFi RTLS uses tags that transmit a WiFi signal to multiple access points throughout a building. Using differential-time-of-arrival methods, the receivers are able to locate the tag.
Ultra wide-band RTLS is the gold standard in terms of location precision. It uses small, low-powered tags that transmit an ultra wide-band signal using a spark-gap-style transmitter. This instantaneous burst of energy creates a very wide signal and transmits across gigahertz of spectrum.
Passive RFID is the type of technology you’ve seen in libraries and retail stores and uses simple, battery-free tags and high-power readers. The readers send out a low-frequency radio signal that transmits so much energy over the air that the tag’s collector antenna picks up its radio waves with brute force. The tag then transmits back using a different frequency, which the reader receives.
Proprietary wireless RTLS solutions use “homegrown” wireless technologies on the tag, the reader, and the network side.
Active Bluetooth-based RTLS uses battery-powered sensors that connect to various access points throughout a particular area and transfer that data to the cloud. These solutions use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to reduce system and operational costs and enable asset tracking.

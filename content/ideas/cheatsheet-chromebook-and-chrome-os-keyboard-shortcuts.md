* [The Chrome OS Cheat Sheet: Every Chromebook Keyboard Shortcut](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/chrome-os-cheat-sheet/)

Switching from a PC to a Chromebook comes with a few adjustments.
For one, you’ll need to have access to a WiFi signal for most Chrome apps to function.
Also, the Chromebook doesn't have a standard PC keyboard (e.g. no Page Up / Down keys).
There is also a number of keyboard shortcuts you’ll need to learn,
and touchpad motions that are different from the average PC.

# Keyboard Shortcuts
Google's Chrome OS uses some familiar keyboard shortcuts as well as some unique ones.
A few of these access Chrome OS settings
and others take the place of missing physical keys on Chromebook keyboards
( e.g. Page Up, Page Down, Home, End).

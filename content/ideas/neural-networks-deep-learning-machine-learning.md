# Definitions
http://searchbusinessanalytics.techtarget.com/definition/deep-learning

## Artificial Intelligence
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines,
especially computer systems.
These processes include learning (the acquisition of information and rules for using the information),
reasoning (using the rules to reach approximate or definite conclusions), and self-correction.
* **Machine learning** is a type of artificial intelligence (AI)
that provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can
teach themselves to grow and change when exposed to new data.
* An **expert system** is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has
expert knowledge and experience in a particular field.
Typically, an expert system incorporates a knowledge base containing accumulated experience
and an inference or rules engine. A set of rules make up the knowledge base that are to be applied to the target domain.
Some expert systems may include machine learning capabilities that allow them to improve
their performance based on experience, just as humans do.

* **natural language processing (NLP)** uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
* **speech recognition** uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies
* **machine vision** uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies

## Data Mining
* **Data mining** is sorting through data to identify patterns and establish relationships.
Data mining parameters include:
    * Association - looking for patterns where one event is connected to another event
     *Sequence or path analysis - looking for patterns where one event leads to another later event
     *Classification - looking for new patterns (May result in a change in the way the data is organized but that's ok)
     *Clustering - finding and visually documenting groups of facts not previously known
     *Forecasting - discovering patterns in data that can lead to reasonable predictions about the future (This area of data mining is known as predictive analytics.)
* **Predictive analytics** is the branch of data mining concerned
with the prediction of future probabilities and trends.
Multiple predictors are combined into a predictive model, which, when subjected to analysis,
can be used to forecast future probabilities with an acceptable level of reliability.
The central element of predictive analytics is the predictor,
a variable that can be measured for an individual or other entity to predict future behavior.
Multiple predictors are combined into a predictive model, which, when subjected to analysis,
can be used to forecast future probabilities with an acceptable level of reliability.

# Embedded Learning Library (ELL)
Microsoft has released the [Embedded Learning Library (ELL)](https://github.com/Microsoft/ELL),
offering developers a pre-trained image recognition model for Raspberry Pi and other developer boards.

Appears this is part of Microsoft's effort to miniaturize its machine-learning software
for a range of extremely low-powered chips on devices that aren't connected to the cloud.i
This effort could make simple things "smart" without connection to the cloud.
Microsoft claims it has compression machine learning models 10 to 100 times smaller,
but to get it running on a Cortex M0 process (a typical micro-controller you'll find in a smart device),
the models need to be 1,000 to 10,000 times smaller.

To make it work on a Raspberry Pi, Microsoft compressed neural network
parameters down to just a few bits instead of the usual 32
and pruning the neural networks down to remove redundancies.
Microsoft claims to be able to make an image detection system run about
20 times faster on a Raspberry Pi 3 without any loss of accuracy.

There is also an open source initiative like this call [The Fido Project](http://fidoproject.github.io/).

# Operating System for the Internet of Things
[RIOT][01] is an operating system designed for the particular requirements
of Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. These requirements comprise a low memory footprint,
high energy efficiency, real-time capabilities, a modular and configurable communication stack,
and support for a wide range of low-power devices.

[Brillo][03] is Google's entry to the IoT platform wars.
At [Google I/O conference][02], the company announced Brillo as the
"underlying operating system for the Internet of things,"
with a developer preview coming in Q3 of 2015.
Brillo is "derived" from Android but "polished" at the lower levels.
It supports WiFi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and other Android things.
Additionally there's Weave coming 2015Q4
Weave is across platform, common language that will let
Brillo devices, phones, and the Internet all talk to one another.

[Contiki][04] also claims to be an open source operating system for the Internet of Things.

IoT-LAB provides various embedded operating systems,
ports of leading open-source projects to IoT-LAB open-nodes hardware. Selected OS-es are well suited for the Internet Of Things.

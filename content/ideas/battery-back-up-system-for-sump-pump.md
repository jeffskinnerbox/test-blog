Subject: Battery Back Up System For Sump Pump

Hi Jennie,

Here are the links to the company that makes the inverter and one source for
the battery.  You may be forced to buy the battery locally as opposed to
ordering online because most places want a battery core for replacement or
the other thing is that the shipping is very expensive.  Amazon wants
$175.00 shipping.

Here is my sump pump emergency battery backup system:

A [deep-cycle battery][01] is a [lead-acid battery][02] designed to be
regularly deeply discharged using most of its capacity.
In contrast, starter batteries (e.g. most automotive batteries)
are designed to deliver short, high-current bursts,
thus frequently discharging only a small part of their capacity.

A [sealed battery][03] can be mounted in any orientation,
and do not require constant maintenance.
The term "maintenance free" is a misnomer as these batteries still require
cleaning and regular functional testing.

A [rechargeable battery][04] is a type of battery which can be charged,
discharged into a load, and recharged many times,
as opposed to a one-time use disposable or primary battery.

[Uninterruptible power supply (UPS)][05] is an electrical apparatus that provides
emergency power to a load when the input power source or mains power fails.

A [inverter][06] is an electronic device or circuitry
that changes direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC).

```bash
# install certutil and other tools
sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools

# list all your certificates
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L
```

If your using a browser running on the Raspberry Pi,
enter `https://localhost:4443`.
If not, use the host name or IP address (e.g. `https://SynSen:4443`).
The first time you do this your access, will be blocked
and this is because you haven't installed the self-signed certificate,
On Chrome, this blockage can be overridden but its best to [install the certificate][19].

In the following text,
`certificate.pem` is the certificate file originating from the Raspberry Pi / Mozilla Things Gateway.
To install the certificate for use by you Linux operating system,
your fist move the certificate to it from the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# copy the certificate to your local system
cd ~/Downloads
scp pi@SynSen:/home/pi/src/gateway/ssl/certificate.pem synsen-things-gateway.pem

# copy certificate to its destination
sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra
sudo cp synsen-things-gateway.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra/synsen-things-gateway.crt

# update your certifications to make it active
sudo update-ca-certificates
```

After these steps the new certification is known by system utilities like `curl` and `get`.
Unfortunately, this does not affect most web browsers like Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome.
To [install the certificate so your Chrome browser can use it][20] in the future,
do the following:

```bash
# install certutil and other tools
sudo apt-get install libnss3-tools

# list all your certificates
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L

# add the certificate for chrome
cd ~/Downloads
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -A -t "P,," -n 'SynSen Mazilla Things Gateway Certificate' -i synsen-things-gateway.pem

# list all your certificates and make sure its added
certutil -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L
```

By the way, you need to delete a certificate do the following:

```bash
# remove certificates used by chrome
certutil -D -d sql:$HOME/.pki/nssdb -n <name of certificate>

# see a list of all your certificates and their names
certutil -d sql$HOME/.pki/nssdb -L
```

Consider forking the following utility and making your own tools:

* [File Encryptor/Decryptor](https://github.com/alkass/file-encryptor)
* [Text Encryption/Decryption](http://fadialkass.blogspot.com/2013/09/text-encryptiondecryption.html)



[Riseup][01], a provider of online communication tools for people working on social change,
has some excellent, non-techie documentation on [online security][02] in general
and [encryption tools][03] like gpg.

 openssl is really the solution for encrypting streams (http connects, ssh, etc.)
 and gpg is a solution for block encryption (files, things of fixed length).

# How Public Key Encryption Works
How do you validate the identity of the party they are talking to
and do you communicate securely with them once validated[^A]?
Many schemes that attempt to answer this question require,
at least at some point, the transfer of a password or other identifying credentials,
over an insecure medium.

[^A]
:   Password authentication and file encryption use a [different methodology][05]
    for authentication than you would use to secure a website.

To get around this issue,
GPG relies on a security concept known as public key encryption.
The idea is that you can split the encrypting and decrypting stages
of the transmission into two separate pieces.
That way, you can freely distribute the encrypting portion,
as long as you secure the decrypting portion.
This scheme allows for a one-way message transfer that can be created and encrypted by anyone,
but only be decrypted by the designated user
(the one with the private decrypting key).
If both of the parties create public/private key pairs and give each other their public encrypting keys,
they can both encrypt messages to each other.

# Someone Sends Their Encryption Key
* [Encrypting and decrypting documents](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x110.html)
* [Is it possible to use a gpg public key to encrypt a message without importing the key?](http://serverfault.com/questions/696178/is-it-possible-to-use-a-gpg-public-key-to-encrypt-a-message-without-importing-th)

If someone send you their encription key, with it, you can encript text and return them a secure message.
For example, if you recieve the key below:

```
xxx
```

Place this key in a file, we'll call it here `bobs_key.txt`,
and we have atext file we wish to encript called `bobs_message.txt`,
then we can create the encripted message as follows:

```bash
# xxx
gpg --output credentrials.gpg --encrypt --recipient stuart@gathman.org jeff-irland-connection-credentrials.json

# xxx
gpg -e -u jeff.irland@verizon.net -r stuart@gathman.org jeff-irland-connection-credentrials.json

# xxx
gpg --output jeff-irland-connection-credentrials.gpg --encrypt jeff-irland-connection-credentrials.json
```

# Key Server or Key Ring
In computer security, a key server is a computer that receives and then serves existing cryptographic keys to users or other programs. The users' programs can be working on the same network as the key server or on another networked computer.
keyserver = ~/.gnupg

* [MIT PGP Public Key Server](https://pgp.mit.edu/faq.html)
* [SKS OpenPGP Public Key Server](http://keys.gnupg.net/)


# Generate Your GPG Keys
GPG is often installed by default on Linux, but it is not,
you can install it with: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`.

To begin using GPG to encrypt your communications,
you need to create your public/private key pair.
You can do this by issuing the following command: `gpg --gen-key`

* [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing))

```bash
 $ gpg --gen-key

Always keep your passphrase secret!
Even if your secret key is accessed by someone else,
they will be unable to use it without your passphrase.
Do not choose a passphrase that someone else might easily guess.

# Sharing Your Public Key
If you want to give or send a file copy of your key to someone,
use this command to write it to an ASCII text file:
`gpg --export --armor jeff.irland@verizon.net > jeff-irland-pubkey.txt`.

The option `--armor` means [ASCII armor][04] and involves encasing encrypted messaging
in ASCII so that they can be sent in a standard messaging format such as email.

```bash
$ gpg --export --armor jeff.irland@verizon.net

# Generating a Revocation Certificate
You need to have a way of invalidating your key pair in case there is a security breach,
or in case you lose your secret key.
This revocation key must be generated ahead of time and kept in a secure,
separate location in case your computer is compromised or inoperable.

```bash
$ gpg --gen-revoke jeff.irland@verizon.net

sec  4096R/870B9147 2016-03-17 Jeff Irland (for use with Stuart Gathman, Chantilly Mesh Network) <jeff.irland@verizon.net>

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
  0 = No reason specified
  1 = Key has been compromised
  2 = Key is superseded
  3 = Key is no longer used
  Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 0
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
>
Reason for revocation: No reason specified
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Jeff Irland (for use with Stuart Gathman, Chantilly Mesh Network) <jeff.irland@verizon.net>"

Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!

If you later issue the revocation certificate,
it notifies others that the public key is not to be used.
Users may still use a revoked public key to verify old signatures,
but not encrypt messages.
As long as you still have access to the private key,
messages received previously may still be decrypted.

# Revoking a Key
When you want to implement your revocation certificate,
you must import it into your local keyserver as follows:

```bash
gpg --import revoke.asc
```

Once you locally revoke the key,
you should send the revoked certificate to a keyserver,
regardless of whether the key was originally issued in this way.
Distribution through a server helps other users to quickly become aware the key has been compromised.

Export to a keyserver with the following command:

```bash
gpg --keyserver subkeys.pgp.net --send KEYNAME
```

For KEYNAME, substitute either the key ID of your primary keypair
or any part of a user ID that identifies your keypair.

# How To Import Other Users' Public Keys
You can import someone's public key in a variety of ways.
If you've obtained a public key from someone in a text file,
GPG can import it with the following command:

```bash
gpg --import name_of_pub_key_file
```

There is also the possibility that the person you are wishing to communicate
with has uploaded their key to a public key server.
These key servers are used to house people's public keys from all over the world.
A popular key server that syncs its information with a variety of other servers
is the MIT public key server.
You can search for people by their name
or email address by going here with your web browser:
`http://pgp.mit.edu/`.

You can also search the key server from within GPG by typing the following:

```bash
#  find your friendâ€™s key on a public keyserver
gpg --search-keys 'myfriend@his.isp.com' --keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
```

# Verify the Other Person's Identity
How do you know that the person giving you the public key is who they say they are?
You may not know the other party personally, or you may be separated by physical distance. If you never want to communicate over insecure channels, verification of the public key could be problematic.
Instead of verifying the entire public keys of both parties,
you can simply compare the "fingerprint" derived from these keys.
This will give you a reasonable assurance that you both are using the same public key information.

You can get the fingerprint of a public key by typing:
`gpg --fingerprint your_email@address.com`

```bash
$ gpg --fingerprint jeff.irland@verizon.net
pub   4096R/870B9147 2016-03-17 [expires: 2016-03-24]
      Key fingerprint = 21E9 C0EA D7EE 5066 2D0F  3D77 746E 6572 870B 9147
uid                  Jeff Irland (for use with Stuart Gathman, Chantilly Mesh Network) <jeff.irland@verizon.net>
sub   4096R/83C63391 2016-03-17 [expires: 2016-03-24]

$
```

This produces a much more manageable string of numbers to compare with the person themselves,
or someone else who has access to that person.

# Encrypt and Decrypt Messages with GPG
## Encryption
You can encrypt messages using the `--encrypt` flag for GPG.
The basic syntax would be:

```bash
gpg --encrypt --sign --armor -r person@email.com name_of_file
```

The parameters basically encrypt the email,
sign it with your private key to guarantee that it is coming from you,
and generates the message in a text format instead of raw bytes.

You should also include a second "-r" recipient with your own email address
if you want to be able to read the message ever.
This is because the message will be encrypted with each person's public key,
and will only be able to be decrypted with the associated private key.

## Decryption
To decrypt a message, you simply receive the complete message
and then call GPG on the message file with no flags: `gpg file_name`.
The software will prompt you as necessary.
Alternatively, you can spesify the output file

You'll recieve a file containing a block of text like this
(note that it incldues the phrase "-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----"):

```
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
Version: GnuPG v1

# List Your Keys
```bash
# list the keys in your public key ring
gpg --list-keys

# list the keys in your secret key ring
gpg --list-secret-keys
```

# Deleting Your Keys
```bash
# delete a private key from your private key ring
gpg --delete-secret-key "User Name"

# delete a public key from your public key ring
gpg --delete-key "User Name"
```

This removes the public key from your public key ring.
NOTE! If there is a private key on your private key ring associated with a public key,
you will get an error!
You must delete your private key for this key pair from your private key ring first.




# Recoverable Secrets
Just about the worst thing you can do is use the same password across several services,
meaning that an attack on one gives entry to multiple accounts.
The challenge is to generate a unique and secure password for each and every application.

HaseDice is not a password manager, or an app, but a simple method that can be readily applied.
A simple dice is used to create random numbers,
which are used to select words from a list to form the basic secret phrase.
This is then combined with the name of the service or application to be accessed,
the date, and a salt, before hashing using the SHA256 algorithm.
The final hash is then truncated to create the password.
You can do it all on a device thatâ€™s airgapped from the world,
ensuring your core secret is never exposed, thus maintaining security.

# Secure Shell (SSH)
Secure Shell (SSH) is a cryptographic network protocol for operating network services
securely over an unsecured network.
Typical applications include remote command-line, login, and remote command execution,
but any network service can be secured with SSH.

## Share Terminal Access (tty-share)
[tty-share][06] enables you to do terminal sharing over the Internet.
Its an extremely simple means for a remote person to join a shared session you establish.

# Git-Secret
What if your application needs WiFi credentials to operate,
so how do I store them out on GitHub without exposing my home WiFi to Internet riffraff?
The tool [`git-secret`][08] (GitHub repository [here][09]) helps solve this problem.
`git-secret` is a shell utility to store your private data inside a `git` repository.
It encrypts using `gpg` and the public keys of all the users that you trust.
So everyone of them can decrypt these files using only their personal secret key.
There are no passwords that change.
When someone leaves your circle of trust, just delete their public key,
re-encrypt the files, and they wonâ€™t be able to decrypt secrets anymore.

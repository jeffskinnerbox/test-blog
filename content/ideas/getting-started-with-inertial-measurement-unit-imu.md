# Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
In robotic mapping, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment
while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it.
While this initially appears to be a chicken-and-egg problem,
there are several algorithms known for solving it, at least approximately,
in tractable time for certain environments.
Popular approximate solution methods include the particle filter and extended Kalman filter.

# What Is an Inertial Measurement Unit?
An inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a device that directly measures the
three linear acceleration components and the three rotational rate components (6-DOF) of a vehicle.
An [IMU is a critical sensor in an autonomous vehicle][15] because
an IMU requires no connection or knowledge of the external world.

A IMU is a single unit in the electronics module
which collects angular velocity and linear acceleration data which is sent to the main processor.
The IMU housing actually contains multiple separate sensors.
An IMU is a key component of navigational equipment used in airplanes, spacecraft, and water-borne vehicles, and also important for virtual reality  equipment and robotics.

When specifying a IMU, you'll see the term Degrees of Freedom (DOF)
which refers to the movement of a rigid body inside space.
It is the different basic ways in which an object can move or be oriented in space.
How many DOF you have is dependent on the application
(e.g. some movements could be constrained by the application,
like a radio control car which can only move on a surface where an airplane can move in 3 dimensional space).
Here we will be looking at 10 DOF in total,
and these can be divide them into 4 different types: translation, rotation, orientation, and elevation:

* **Translation Movement** -  A body is free to translate in 3 degrees of freedom: forward/back, up/down, left/right. This is generally masured using an accelerometer.
* **Rotation Movement** - A body can also rotate with 3 degrees of freedom: pitch, yaw, and roll.  This is generally measured using a gyroscope.
* **Orientation** - A body has 3 degrees of freedom to describe the direction it points relative to the earth.  This is generally measured using a gyroscope and magnetometer.
* **Elevation** - A body can move in 1 degree of freedom (up/down) relative to its position on the earth.  This is gnerally measured using a combination of a accelerometer and barmeter.

IMUs have been known to suffer is positional drift,
whereby incremental errors in recording are carried over to the next set of measurements.
This positional drift, or accumulated error,
can lead to some inaccuracies in the reported location,
particularly over longer periods of time.
Additional components of navigation systems are designed to correct these incremental errors,
including magnetic compasses, externally mounted velocity sensors, and GPS control.

When using the IMU to calculate angles, readings from both the gyro and accelerometer are needed which are then combined. This is because using either on their own will result in inaccurate readings. And a special note about yaw.

Here is why;
Gyros - A gyro measures the rate of rotation, which has to be tracked over time to calculate the current angle. This tracking causes the gyro to drift. However, gyros are good at measuring quick sharp movements.

Accelerometers - Accelerometers are used to sense both static (e.g. gravity) and dynamic (e.g. sudden starts/stops) acceleration. They don’t need to be tracked like a gyro and can measure the current angle at any given time. Accelerometers however are very noisy and are only useful for tracking angles over a long period of time.

Accelerometers cannot measure yaw.   To explain it simply, yaw is when the accelerometer is on a flat level surface and it is rotated clockwise or anticlockwise.  As the Z-Axis readings will not change, we cannot measure yaw.   A gyro and a magnetometer can help you measure yaw. This will be covered in a future guide.

[Here is an excellent tutorial about accelerometers and gyros.](https://www.instructables.com/id/Accelerometer-Gyro-Tutorial/)

# Magnetometer
A digital compass, or magnetometer have 2 major downfalls.
One, they can not be used around any magnet of any real strength.
It will really throw off the reading or just report the direction of the magnet
if it is strong or close enough
(though in some applications, you could use that to your advantage).
And second, without something called “[tilt compensation][10]”,
the compass will only be accurate held at +/- a few degrees of level.
Tilt compensated compasses require accelerometers, a microprocessor,
and will be two to three times as expensive.

Generally, the magnetometer's reading is used to measure change from a reference point
and not an absolution measure of direction.
The megnetometer points to [magnetic north][11], and not [true north][12]
(The difference between them is called [magnetic declination][13]).

[10-dof-imu!](http://www.alliedelec.com/images/products/Small/70460797.jpg)
Adafruit's 10-DOF IMU (10 Degrees of Freedom, Inertial Measurement Unit).
This board contains 3 separate IMU chips, all rolled into to one printed circuit board:

* [LSM303DLHC][01] - 3-axis accelerometer (up to +/-16g) and a 3-axis magnetometer (up to +/- 8.1 gauss) on a single chip
* [L3GD20][02] - 3-axis gyroscope (up to +/-2000 dps)
* [BMP180][03] - barometric pressure sensor (300..1100 hPa) that can be used to calculate altitude, with an additional on-board temperature sensors for calibration

Any one of these individual sensors could be suitable for some applications,
but this unit with 10 DOF provides nearly all that you need.
The only thing missing is absolution position on earth obtainable
via the Global Positioning System (GPS).
In principle, with the GPS, you could eliminate the BMP180 and LSM303DLHC,
but these sensors can give you greater precision, and therefore,
still generally desirable to have for sensor fusion.

# Sensor Fusion
When using the IMU to calculate angles,
readings from both the gyroscopes and accelerometer are needed, which are then combined.
This is because using either on their own will result in inaccurate readings.
Here is why;

* **Gyroscope** – A gyro measures the rate of rotation,
which has to be tracked over time to calculate the current angle.
This tracking causes the gyro to drift.
However, gyros are good at measuring quick sharp movements.
* **Accelerometers** – Accelerometers are used to sense both static (e.g. gravity)
and dynamic (e.g. sudden starts/stops) acceleration.
They don’t need to be tracked like a gyro and can measure the current angle at any given time.
Accelerometers however are very noisy and are only useful for tracking angles over a long period of time.

The data needs to be integrated together to make it useful.
[Sensor fusion][04] is combining of sensory data or data derived from disparate sources
such that the resulting information has less uncertainty than would be possible
when these sources were used individually.

# Connecting with the Board
All of the sensors on the Adafruit 10DOF breakout board communicate via a two-pin I2C bus.

# Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C)
The [Inter-Integrated Circuit or I2C][05] (pronounced as either I-squared-C or I-2-C)
is generically referred to as a "two-wire interface" or "2-wire serial bus".
It's a multi-master serial single-ended computer bus invented by Philips
that is used to attach low-speed peripherals to a
motherboard, embedded system, cellphone, or other electronic device.

I2C can be used to connect up to 127 nodes via a bus has two data wires, called SCL and SDA.
SCL is the clock line. It is used to synchronize all data transfers over the I2C bus.
SDA is the data line. Of course, there is a third wire being ground.
There may also be a 5 volt wire to distribute power to the devices.
Both SCL and SDA lines are "open drain" drivers.
What this means is that the chip can drive its output low,
but it cannot drive it high.
For the line to be able to go high you must provide pull-up resistors to the 5v supply.
There should be a resistor from the SCL line to the 5v line and another from the SDA line to the 5v line.
The value of the resistors is not critical.
Anything from 1800 ohms to 47K ohms used (1.8K, 47K and 10K are common values).
You only need one set of pull-up resistors for the whole I2C bus,
not for each device, as illustrated below:

<p style="text-align:center;">
    <a href="http://jeffskinnerbox.wordpress.com/2012/12/05/drive-a-16x2-lcd-with-the-raspberry-pi/i2c-diagram-and-description-2/#main" rel="attachment wp-att-906">
    <img class="aligncenter  wp-image-906" alt="I2C Diagram and Description" src="/images/i2c-diagram-and-description1.jpg" width="436" height="293" />
    </a>
</p>

In theory the I2C bus can support multiple masters, but most micro-controllers can’t.
A master is usually a microcontroller, although it doesn’t have to be.
Slaves can be ICs or microcontrollers.
When the master wishes to communicate with a slave it sends a
series of pulses down the SDA and SCL lines.
The data that is sent includes an address that identifies the slave
with which the master needs to interact.
Addresses take 7 bits out of a data byte;
the remaining bit specifies whether the master wishes to read
(get data from a slave) or write (send data to a slave).

Some devices have an address that is entirely fixed by the manufacturer;
others can be configured to take one of a range of possible addresses.
When a micro-controller is used as a slave it is normally possible to configure its address by software,
and for that address to take on any of the 127 possible values.
The address byte may be followed by one or more byes of data,
which may go from master to slave or from slave to master.

When data is being sent on the SDA line,
clock pulses are sent on the SCL line to keep master and slave synchronised.
Since the data is sent one bit at a time, the data transfer rate is one eighth of the clock rate.
The original standard specified a standard clock rate of 100KHz,
and most I2C chips and micro-controllers can support this.
Later updates to the standard introduced a fast speed of 400KHz
and a high speed of 1.7 or 3.4 MHz.
The Arduino and Raspberry Pi can support standard and fast speeds.

The fast rate corresponds to a data transfer rate of 50K bytes/sec
which is too slow for some control applications.
One option in that case is to use SPI instead of I2C.

There are several famous quotes I carry around with me
and share with others from time to time.
The are illustrative of how we human beings can be so very wrong,
or as in the quote relevant now, we can be so amazingly insightful:

**I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam**
Charles Babbage - http://www.azquotes.com/quote/653911

We live in an analog world.
There are an infinite amount of colors to paint an object
(even if the difference is indiscernible to our eye),
there are an infinite number of tones we can hear,
and there are an infinite number of smells we can smell.
The common theme among all of these analog signals is their infinite possibilities.

Digital signals and objects deal in the realm of the discrete or finite,
meaning there is a limited set of values they can be.
How can this possibly be better?

# Digital Disruption
Companies today are rushing headlong to become more digital.
But what does digital really mean?

# Digitization
Digitization is the process of converting information into a digital format.
In this format, information is organized into discrete units of data (called bits)
that can be separately addressed (usually in multiple-bit groups called bytes).
This is the binary data that computers and many devices with computing capacity

Audio and video digitization uses one of many analog-to-digital conversion processes
in which a continuously variable (analog) signal is changed,
without altering its essential content, into a multi-level (digital) signal.
The process of sampling measures the amplitude (signal strength) of an analog waveform
at evenly spaced time markers and represents the samples as numerical values for input as digital data.

Digitizing information makes it easier to preserve, access, and share.
For example, an original historical document may only be accessible to people who visit its physical location,
but if the document content is digitized, it can be made available to people worldwide.
There is a growing trend towards digitization of historically and culturally significant data.

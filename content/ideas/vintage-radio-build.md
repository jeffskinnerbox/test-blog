## Crystal Radio
The first radio receivers were crystal sets,
and became available in the 1920's with the opening of
Marconi's first broadcast station in Chelmsford.

## Tuned Radio Frequency Receiver
The tuned radio frequency receiver (or TRF receiver)
was patented in 1916 by Ernst Alexanderson and popular in the 1920s.
Early examples could be tedious to operate because when tuning in a station
each stage had to be individually adjusted to the station's frequency,
but later models had ganged tuning,
the tuning mechanisms of all stages being linked together,
and operated by just one control knob.
By the mid 1930s, it was replaced by the superheterodyne receiver.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuned_radio_frequency_receiver

## Superheterodyne Receiver
The superheterodyne receiver (often shortened to superhet)
uses frequency mixing to convert a received signal to a fixed intermediate frequency (IF)
which can be more conveniently processed than the original carrier frequency.
It was invented Edwin Armstrong in 1918.
Virtually all modern radio receivers use the superheterodyne principle.

# Crystal Radio
![lost-knowladge](http://i0.wp.com/cdn.makezine.com/uploads/2009/02/lk_banner2.jpg?resize=189%2C207)
A crystal radio is basically a high Q resonator tied to an antenna and an envelope detector.
These days the envelope detector is a point contact diode such as a 1N34 Germanium diode.

The resonant circuit passes a specific wavelength (or more specifically range of wavelengths depending on its Q). The diode detector provides the amplitude or envelope of the signal(s) within that wavelength. A high impedance or highly sensitive ear piece converts this envelope to an audible signal that you can listen to.

The neat thing about crystal radios is that no active RF amplification is used. The radio is powered by the incoming radio signal that it is tuned to. More sophisticated crystal sets might have more than one tuned stage, perhaps 3 or 4 to minimize receiver bandwidth for maximum sensitivity and selectivity.

The primary receiver used on the Titanic’s Marconi station was basically a 3-stage crystal radio except that it used a magnetic detector rather than a semiconductor

# Coherer
The [coherer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherer)
is a primitive form of radio signal detector used in the first radio receivers during the wireless telegraphy era at the beginning of the 20th century.
The Coherer had many short comings as a detector and
around 1905 will be replaced by the Fleming Valve (aka Diode Vacuum Tube)
and De Forest's Audion (aka Triode Vacuum Tube).
For more information, see Kathy Balistreri excellent videos on the ["Secret History of Electricity"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYrX5FiWjiPd0JytMh6NX1Q)

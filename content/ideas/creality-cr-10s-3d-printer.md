Reference Shapeways cost vs 3D-Printing yourself


I waged a long mental debate about the merits of purchasing a 3D Printer.
For one thing, a have a well equipped woodworking workshop,
and I figured if I needed to print a special part,
I could use one of the many online 3D printing services like [Shapeways][62].
In time, I learned that the [3D Printer could be great addition for woodworking][58],
and besides, I had gotten into electronics where the use [3D printing custom enclosures][59] is frequently done.
And now, [thanks in part to NASA support][60],
we have the possibility of [print the enclosure and the electronic together][61].

There is a [very wide range of 3D printer options in the market][02]
(you can pay [$200 to $1M for 3D printing][03]).
The Creality CR-10 3D-printer line is considered
[one of the best low-budget 3D printers available on the market][01].
Its known for its print quality,
models with large 300x300x400 mm / 400x400x400 mm / 500x500x500 mm build areas
comes nearly assembled and takes less than an hour to set-up.

In Decenber of 2018, I purchased the Creality CR-10S (aka CR-10S 300)
with a build area of 300x300x400 mm from [Gearbest][10] for $420, including shiping.
The [CR-10 S4][11] has a build volume of 400x400x400mm
and the [CR-10 S5][12] has a build volume of 500x500x500mm.
The following reviews helped me make this choose:

# 3D vs. 2.5D Printing
3D printers by in large print in a planer fashion,
that is, printing in a series of 2D planes stacked up to form a 3D shape.
True 3D printing is a non-planar technique creates geometry with true 3D tool paths
that can eliminate the steps often seen on shallow surfaces.

* [How’s That 2.5D Printer Working For You?](https://hackaday.com/2019/09/09/hows-that-2-5d-printer-working-for-you/)

# Barriers to Entry
One of the biggest reasons there isn’t a 3D printer in every home yet has nothing to do with price or availability.
It’s the fact that if you want to design and print your own objects,
you need to know how to use relatively complex 3D modelling software.

# Filament
Which filament to use can be an important decisions you make.
I choose [Hatchbox][44] because of its availability on Amazon, reasonable price, wide color verity,
but mainly [it get great reviews][43].

* https://hackaday.com/2018/09/12/pla-the-plastic-that-grows/

You have to use 1.75mm filament with the CR-10.
It's possible to use other sizes, but not without heavy modification.

Generally PLA is the easiest material to print with, at least as you are starting out.
They come in rolls of 1kg (2.2 pounds).

With any filament there's some settings you will have to tweak to get the best performance out of it.
You can play around with retraction settings to reduce the amount of stringing you get on the prints.
I believe PLA is good from 185-210 nozzle temperature, and you'll want about 60 for the heated bed.

Apart from the standard PLA filament, the CR-10 / CR-10S is also equipped to print
with a wider range of materials such as the:

* **PLA -** Poly(lactic acid) or polylactic acid or polylactide (PLA) is a biodegradable and bioactive thermoplastic aliphatic polyester derived from renewable resources, such as corn starch (in the United States and Canada), cassava roots, chips or starch (mostly in Asia), or sugarcane (in the rest of the world).
* **ABS -** (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is another commonly used 3D printer material. Best used for making durable parts that need to withstand higher temperatures. In comparison to PLA filament, ABS plastic is less "brittle" and more "ductile."
* **PETG -** Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) is a water clear material and designed to be very 'easy to use' in a range of applications. It's a thermoplastic polymer created through the copolymerisation of PET and ethylene glycol.
 This filament is an extra tough 3D print material. This is an extreme high strength filament and can achieve very sturdy and strong prints. It has very low shrinkage, making this perfect for larger flat surfaces.
 * **TPU -** Thermoplastic polyurethane belongs to a class of polyurethane plastics having many important properties such as elasticity, transparency, and resistance to grease, oil, and abrasion. It is unique due to its extremely flexible nature. Technically speaking, TPUs are made up of thermoplastic elastomers.
* **PC -** Polycarbonate is a strong, durable, and tough material. It's a naturally transparent thermoplastic with high impact resistance and excellent heat resistance.

# Slicers
3D printing is comprised of a few essential tools.
Obviously, you have the 3D model and the 3D printer,
but there’s an instrumental piece to the puzzle right in between those two points.
3D printing slicer software essentially acts as the middleman between the 3D model and printer.
3D printing slicer prepares the selected model for your 3D printer by generating g-code,
which is a widely used numerical control (NC) programming language.
There is a [large number of slicing software out there][45], many of which are free.

## Cura
The very first slicer I used was Ultimaker's [Cura][47],
and still is the primary slicer I use.
Its a good tool to start with since its free and not overly intimidating for a beginner.
Cura is the friendly face of slicing software
but Cura’s more complex settings are there if you need them.
Hidden (but not too deeply) in the Cura software are almost all those settings
and options that you can find in the majority of other slicing software.
So if you like to tinker with the 3D printer settings, you can.

Installation is very simple, just follow the [online install instructions][47].

### Step X: Install and Configure Cura - DONE
Cura is an open source 3D printer slicing application.
* [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/en/products/ultimaker-cura-software)

To install Cura, I followed the procedures documented at
[Cura's PPA site for the stable release](https://launchpad.net/~thopiekar/+archive/ubuntu/cura).
This process is as follows, installing Cura version 4.1.0-PPA:

```bash
# install the link to stable version of Cura
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:thopiekar/cura

# update your repositories
sudo apt-get update

# install cura
sudo apt-get install cura
```

Next, start-up Cura via the commandline with `cura`.
You'll get prompted to add information about your 3D printer.
I selected **Other** > **Creality 10**.

### Step X: Skirts, Brims, Rafts and Supports
A raft is a platform printed under a print to ad print bed adhesion.i
A brim is printed on the sides on the print.
A skirt is printed away from the print to start the flow of filament.

3d Printers are able to “bridge” 90 degree overhangs for a limited distance.  While the general rule of thumb is 5mm, in fact depending on how flat you need the bridge they can often reach up to 50mm.

Many printers require supports when the overhang exceeds 45 to 50 degrees
The overhang angle is measured from the vertical not from the base.

## Step X: Selecting Your Test Print - DONE
I'm going to use [3DBenchy][04] as my first test print.
This popular "first print" is designed to offer a large array of
[challenging geometrical features for 3D printers][05],
and touch on different issues related to additive manufacturing.
The 3D model is designed to print at 1:1 scale without support materials.
It is challenging for most 3D printers but the small volume (15.55 cm3)
typically prints in well under two hours and does not require much material.

You'll find [many sites][08] where you can download the CAD / STL files for 3DBenchy.
The site I choose was [Thingiverse][09].
For my test run, I followed the advice of the video
"[Creality CR-10 Calibration, Settings, and First Print!][13]".
I selected **Settings** >  **Printers** > **Manage Printers...** > **Machine Settings**
and the only thing I needed to change was the **Gcode flavor**.

My second test print was a [human skull on Thingiverse][14],
third was a large [nuts, bolts, and washer][53],
and the forth was a [parametric butt hinge][54].

## Step X: Removing Cura Package and the PPA
I installed Cura via a PPA and is expected to have the latest and greatest version of Cura.
But this PPA, like many PPAs, is managed by a single developer for personal or limited use.
Over the time, these PPAs might not be updated with latest version of operating system.
This might create trouble when you need to [updating Ubuntu][50],
or in general, your operating system is inconsistent with the PPA's support direction.
(In my case, my Ubuntu was at version level 18.04.2 and the PPA wasn't supporting it.
I needed to get to 18.10).

>**Note:** You should remove the application installed by
>the PPA before removing the PPA itself.
>You can use the `apt remove` command for that.

There are several ways to [remove a PPA in Ubuntu][51].
The [developer of the PPA recommends][52] the following:

```bash
# make sure the ppa-remove tool is installed
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ppa-purge

# remove the ppa and its application it supports
sudo ppa-purge ppa:thopiekar/cura
```

## Slic3r
[Slic3r][46] is one of the most widely used open source slicers.
It's best suited for the more advanced users with its large number of features and options.

### Installing Slic3r
#### Step X: Installing Slic3r
If you installed Slic3r via the Ubuntu package manager,
you'll get code that dates back to 2015 but classified as "stable".
I chose to install the most [recent official release][48] that was available
(verison 1.3.0, dated November of 2018).
Detail install instructions can be found [here][49].

```bash
# download slic3r-1.3.0-linux-x64.tar.bz2 from https://dl.slic3r.org/linux/
mkdir ~/Downloads/slic3r
cd ~/Downloads/slic3r

# uncompess the file
tar -xvjf slic3r-1.3.0-linux-x64.tar.bz2

# run the install schell script
cd Slic3r
./Slic3r
```
From here you just follow the Slic3r Configuration Assistant
(If this wizard doesn't popup, select button **Help** > **Configuration Assistant...**).
Enter the following information:

* **G-code flavor:** RepRap
* **Size:** 300, 300
* **Nozzle diameter:** 0.4mm
* **Filament Diameter:** 1.75mm
* **Extrusion Temperature:** 200C
* **Bed Temperature:** 60C

Now move the Slic3r libraries and scripts to a pereminate location:

```bash
# move the libraries and scripts
cd ~/src
mv ~/Downloads/slic3r/Slic3r .

# create symbolic links so its in your PATH
ln -s ~/src/Slic3r/Slic3r ~/bin/slic3r

# test it and get the version
$ slic3r --version
1.3.0
```

cura is upgraded several times a year.

# 3D Printing File Formats

## Stereolithography (STL) File
[STL is a file format][06]
widely used within CAD software.
STL is an abbreviation of "[stereolithography][07]".
Its the most common and universal file format for 3D printing.
It was released in 1987 and it’s dead simple.
An STL file describes a raw, unstructured triangulated surface.

* [STL File Format (3D Printing) – Simply Explained](https://all3dp.com/what-is-stl-file-format-extension-3d-printing/)

## 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) File
The STL file format doesn’t contain any scale, color or material information.
There is no validation, it’s just a bunch of triangles,
so it doesn’t stop you from creating holes, non-manifold edges,
flipped normals, or self-intersecting models.
It’s good enough most of the time, but isn’t there a better file format?

## Additive Manufacturing File (AMF)

# G-code File
[G-code][42] is a language
used mainly in
computer-aided manufacturing and control automated machine tools
(aka [numerical control machine tools][41]).

Your 3D printer's g-code is automatically generated by a slicing program such as Cura.
Because there are hundreds or thousands of movements involved in producing a 3D print,
the g-code can be hundreds of pages long.

# Bed Adhesive
Getting the first layer to adhere to the 3D print bed is critically important.
[Kapton tape][21], [gluestick][22], [painter’s tape][23], and [Aqua Net hairspray][24]
are all used as bed adhesives on FDM (fused deposition modeling) 3D printers.
A common suggestion is to use hairspray, which works,
but the method has its drawbacks and is not without [risk][25].

I choose to use a new method involving sugar.
Sugar appears to work well, especially on a glass beds.
For removal, the print just pops off once the print cools,
and clean up is also very easy.
You just run your glass print bed under some tap water.
Check out "[Sugar As A Bed Adhesive For 3D Printing][26]" for more information.

# Add-Ons, Modification, and Upgrades
The Creality CR-10S comes with some of the upgrades suggested for the orginal CR-10.
This includes filament run out sensor/protection, resume printing function,
improvements to stabilize the hotend temperature,
hotbed thermal insulation pad,
and [dual Z-axis leading screw rods][15].

## Upgrades
Like many 3d printers, my glass bed is not perfectly flat
and might warrant replacing with flatter glass (such as a mirror).
A nice to have, and a potential fix to a not-so-perfect bed,
is the [EZABL Auto Bed Levelinga kit][16].
Some of the typical after market upgrades for the Creality CR-10S are:

To support filaments other that PLA, which require higher temperatures,
it might be advisable to make improvement to the hotend,
like the [Micro Swiss All Metal Hotend][17].

Using a wide range of filaments might also challenge the CR-10S stock extruder
(particularly soft filaments),
so an upgrade to something like the [Bondtech BMG Dual Drive Extruder][18] might be warranted.
[I doesn't have to be expensive][56].

The CR-10S extruder has the motor on the frame, far away from the print head.
A [Bowden tube][19] ((usually made of [PTFE plastic][20])
guides the filament from the fixed motor to the moving hot end.
Without this tube, the filament might just bend and nothing is extruded out the hotend.
There are premium (and pricey) Bowden tubes like the [Capricorn brand][28].

The Creality CR-10S doesn't use bearing idler pulleys with teeth on its belts.
The teeth will help reduce belt skipping, assuming this is a real problem on your setup.
The [WINSINN GT2 Idler Pulley][29] is a cheap upgrade.

Many recommend anti-backlash device on the Z-axis leadscrew.
[Backlash][30] is the gap between the faces of the teeth within gearing systems.
An anti-backlash device is used to 'soaked up' this gap when you change directions.
The [T8 Anti-Backlash Spring Loaded Nut][31] is one such device.

## Add-Ons
The Creality CR-10S can be noisy, which is annoying in its own way,
but noise is also a symptom of vibration which can impact your print.
[May have been pleased][32] by replacing the feet on the CR-10 with [CR-10 Squash Feet][33],
claiming a 7dB sound improvement.
Also, consider a [low profile version of the feet][35]
and these [M3 T-nuts][34] for mounting the feet.

Stepper motors are a source of vibration while printing and can negatively effect the print.
You can improve this by using [stepper motor vibration dampers][36].

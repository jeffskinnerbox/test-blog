Particle (used to be called Spark) has released the third generation of their networked computing boards.
Their new product (third generation), called [Particle Mesh][01],
allows you to connect either to a WiFi or cellular network
but also allows you to create a mesh network between multiple Mesh devices.
There are three models, the Argon, the Boron, and the Xenon.
The Boron, $29, supports LTE while the Argon, $15, connects to Wi-Fi and the $9 Xenon connects only via Bluetooth.

Particle Mesh capabilities are built on the mesh networking technology OpenThread by Alphabet's Nest Labs.
The new portfolio of hardware is built to comply with Adafruit's Feather form factor,
providing compatibility with 50+ FeatherWing hardware accessories.

Particle connectivity plans are now triple the data for the same price.
For $2.99 per month,
developers receive 3MB of data (LTE M1/NB1 and GSM) which includes access to the Particle Device Cloud.

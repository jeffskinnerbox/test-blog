# Snap
Canonical has deployed Snappy Ubuntu Core,
a tiny Linux-based operating system for large-scale cloud container deployments,
IoT devices, mobile phones, and anything that needs transitional updates and tiny footprint.
Snappy Ubuntu Core works more or less like Google’s Chrome OS where
it offers transitional image based updates for the system and apps that can be rolled back,
along with confinement that is known in the container world.

But as the article "[Canonical’s Snap: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://thenewstack.io/canonicals-snap-great-good-bad-ugly/)" nicely outlines, does the world need another containerizer on Linux?



# FloydHub is Heroku for Deep Learning
https://www.floydhub.com/  -   It never ceases to amaze me how what I once considered difficult or requiring special skills can become easy or common almost overnight!!

I have heard of the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 but was put off by its $600 price tag.
I just couldn't justify pay this much money to satisfy my curiosity.
But then in December of 2017, I got an email from NVIDIA,
offering the NVIDIA Jetson TX1 SE (student edition ... doesn't come with a built in camera) for $200.
It's steep, but you're getting a mighty powerful ARM development board
at this price was a nice find.

In 1999, the [ASCI Blue Pacific][06] [super computer][07] was brought
on-line at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, running at 1T FLOPs (nearly 4T FLOPs at peak),
to replace live weapons testing by simulating nuclear weapon tests.
(ASCI stand for [Accelerated Strategic Computing Initiative][05]).

[understanding supercomputer performance][09]

[What is a FLOP?][10]
[What makes a computer "super"?][11]
[floating point operations per second (FLOPS)][08]

For comparison, a handheld calculator performs relatively few FLOPS.
A computer response time below 0.1 second in a calculation context is
usually perceived as instantaneous by a human operator,
so a simple calculator needs only about 10 FLOPS to be considered functional ([source][08]).
The NVIDIA Jetson TX1 Maxwell architecture with 256 CUDA cores
delivering over 1 TeraFLOPs of performance.

# NVIDIA Jetson
The "Nvidia Jetson" is a brand name for a series of computation processor boards from Nvidia.
The Jetson [TK1][14], [TX1 and TX2][13] models are all are carrying a [Tegra][12] processor from Nvidia.

The [numbers supplied by NVIDIA report][04] that the Jetson TX1 performance beats
out an Intel Core i7 6700K Skylake CPU when it comes to deep learning,
but where it really excels is power efficiency.

Maxwell is NVIDIA's 2014 GPU architecture succeeding its Kepler GPU architecture.

# MIT RACECAR
[RACECAR/J][01] is derived from the open source [MIT RACECAR][02],
an “open-source powerful platform for robotics research and education”.
The RACECAR/J Chassis is based on the [TRAXXAS Slash 4×4 Platinum Truck][03],
an upgraded version of the normal Slash 4×4 which adds aluminum bits
and pieces such as C-hubs, steering blocks, rear hub carriers and axle nuts.

# Jetson TX1 Enclosure
For a developer kit enclosure,
I purchased the [JIANGRUI Acrylic TXShell](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072VXYCRZ/)
off of Amazon.
I did a considerable amount of online research
other acrylic shell providers, metal cases, 3d printed enclosures),
and in the end, it met my most important needs at a reasonable price.

# Generate Your GPG Keys
GPG is often installed by default on Linux, but it is not,
you can install it with: `sudo apt-get install gnupg`.

To begin using GPG to encrypt your communications,
you need to create your public/private key pair.
You can do this by issuing the following command: `gpg --gen-key`

* [Entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(computing))

```bash
 $ gpg --gen-key

   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)

RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months

Is this correct? (y/N) y

You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID
from the Real Name, Comment and Email Address in this form:
    "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) <heinrichh@duesseldorf.de>"

Real name: Jeff Irland
Email address: jeff.irland@verizon.net
Comment: for use with Stuart Gathman, Chantilly Mesh Network
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Jeff Irland (for use with Stuart Gathman, Chantilly Mesh Network) <jeff.irland@verizon.net>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Always keep your passphrase secret!
Even if your secret key is accessed by someone else,
they will be unable to use it without your passphrase.
Do not choose a passphrase that someone else might easily guess.

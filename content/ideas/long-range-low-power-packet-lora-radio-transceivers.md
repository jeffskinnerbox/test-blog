# What is LPWAN?
Long life cycles, extremely low cost connectivity requirements,
and ability to connect to devices in difcult to reach places are typical requirements for IoT.
Things like utility meters have historically been challaging to connect,
as traditional technologies such as cellular, WiFi and wired solutions,
didn’t have the link budget to penetrate metal, reach underground or span miles of distances.
Overcoming these core communication challenges of long lifetime, low cost,
and long distance is crucial to enable large scale growth of the IoT.
This is where LPWAN comes in and can be perfect for the Internet of Things.

A low-power wide-area network (LPWAN)
or low-power wide-area (LPWA) network
or low-power network (LPN)
or low power wireless area (LPWA) are network technologies were
there is a type of wireless telecommunication wide area network designed to allow
long range communications at a low bit rate among things (connected objects),
such as sensors operated on a battery.
LPWAN network technologies were specifically designed to solve these diffcult IoT challenges.
LPWAN covers a range of communications options from unlicensed wireless to licensed cellular options,
feature very low power consumption for long lifetime,
can span incredible distances to connect
devices previously thought impossible to reach,
and do so in a cost-efective way that provides the necessary ROI.

## Technical Atributes
* **Long Range:** The operating range of LPWAN technology varies from
a few kilometers in urban areas to over 10 km in rural settings.
It can also enable data communication in challeging indoor and underground locations.
* **Low Power:** Optimized for power consumption, LPWAN transceivers can run on small,
inexpensive batteries for up to 20 years
* **Low Cost:** LPWAN's simplified, lightweight protocols reduce complexity
in hardware design and lower device costs.
Its long range combined with a star topology reduce expensive infrastructure requirements.
* **High Receiver Sensitivity:** Receiver sensitivity is the lowest power level
at which the receiver can detect an RF signal and demodulate data.
Sensitivity is purely a receiver specification and is independent of the transmitter.

## LPWA Networking Standards
Rules and spectrum allocations vary across the world,
but these lower frequencies gets inside buildings better and the use of ultra-narrowband
helps manage signal-to-noise problems at long range, allowing very low-power devices.
The downside is ultra-low data rates, and even further restricted downlink performance.
SigFox, for example, is intended as a wide-area public network,
with the other technologies available as either public or private networks.
Bandwidth restrictions cause some tough challenges for software updates and security,
but nonetheless, the technology is an interesting alternative for long-range, low-power deployments.

Where LoRa is a wideband spread spectrum technology,
SigFox is a narrowband BPSK-binary phase shift keying.
LoRa uses it chirp modulation preamble for signal locking
but SigFox uses it BPSK modulation for signal locking.

## Battery Life
* [LoRa on batteries: How long does it last?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nzej8lzwsY&feature=youtu.be)

# Weightless
Weightless has decided to pursue ultra-narrow-band (UNB) communication in the free-to-use ISM bands,
rather than ‘white space’ radio for its physical layer.
Around the world, agreements, legislation and infrastructure required to use white space radio
(communications in spare TV channels)
are not coming along quickly enough, and Weightless changes its strategy.

# Sigfox
SIGFOX is a cellular style network operator that provides a tailor-made solution
for low-throughput Internet of Things and M2M applications to connect
using ultra-narrow band, UNB technology in the unlicensed ISM radio bands.
UNB technology enables very low transmitter power levels to be used
while still being able to maintain a robust data connection.

* Up to 140 messages per object per day
* Payload size for each message is 12 bytes
* Wireless throughput up to 100 bits per second
* SIGFOX radio link uses unlicensed ISM radio bands. Frequencies can vary according to national regulations, but in Europe the 868MHz band is widely used and in the US it is 915MHz.
* The density of the cells in the SIGFOX network is based on an average range of about 30-50km in rural areas and in urban areas where there are usually more obstructions and noise is greater the range may be reduced to between 3 and 10km. Distances can be much higher for outdoor nodes where SIGFOX states line of sight messages could travel over 1000km.

# LoRa
One of the major issues for machine to machine (M2M) communications
used for applications like the Internet of Things (IoT)
is to enable communications over long ranges using very low power levels.
One scheme for addressing this is known as [LoRa (Low Power Radio)][07].
A LoRa network can be arranged to provide coverage similar to that of a cellular network.
Many LoRa operators are cellular network operators who will be able to use existing masts to mount LoRa antennas.
In some instances the LoRa antennas may be combined with cellular antennas as the frequencies
may be close and combining antennas will provide significant cost advantages.

The LoRa modulation scheme at the heart of a LoRaWAN
was developed to solve challenges facing IoT applications that
needed wide area coverage as well as years-long battery life

A LoRaWAN network uses a star-of-stars topology with gateways serving as a
transparent bridge relaying messages between end-devices and a central network server.
Gateways connect to the network server via standard IP connections,
while end-devices use single-hop wireless communication to one or many gateways.
The structure is similar to a cellular telephony network,
and gateway devices will typically be installed on existing cellular towers,
but instead of providing a single, interconnected network,
the scheme allows multiple independent LoRaWANs to operate in a given geographic area.

[LoRa Alliance][06] is an open,
non-profit association of members whos mission to standardize Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN)
being deployed around the world to enable Internet of Things (IoT), machine-to-machine (M2M),
and smart city, and industrial applications.
The Alliance members will collaborate to drive the global success of the LoRa protocol (LoRaWAN),
by sharing knowledge and experience to guarantee interoperability between operators in one open global standard.

* Long range: 15 - 20 km and the support of millions of nodes
* Long battery life: in excess of ten years
* LoRaWAN specification intended for wireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global network.
* LoRaWAN target key requirements of internet of things such as secure bi-directional communication, mobility, and localization services.
* This standard will provide seamless interoperability among smart Things without the need of complex local installations and gives back the freedom to the user, developer, businesses enabling the role out of Internet of Things.
* LoRaWAN network architecture is typically laid out in a star-of-stars topology in which gateways is a transparent bridge relaying messages between end-devices and a central network server in the backend.
* Gateways are connected to the network server via standard IP connections while end-devices use single-hop wireless communication to one or many gateways.
* All end-point communication is generally bi-directional, but also supports operation such as multicast enabling software upgrade over the air or other mass distribution messages to reduce the on air communication time.
* LoRaWAN data rates range from 0.3 kbps to 50 kbps. To maximize both battery life of the end-devices and overall network capacity, the LoRaWAN network server is managing the data rate and RF output for each end-device individually by means of an adaptive data rate (ADR) scheme.

# What is LoRa?
LoRa is a **Lo**ng **Ra**nge radio technology [developed by Cycleo and acquired by Semtech in 2012][02].
LoRa uses license-free sub-gigahertz radio in the [ISM frequency bands][03]
169 MHz, 433 MHz, 868 MHz (Europe) and 915 MHz (North America).
LoRa enables very-long-range transmissions (more than 10 km in rural areas) with low power consumption.
The technology has two parts:
LoRa, the physical layer and LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network), the upper layers.
So LoRa itself does not describe system functionality above the physical layer
(i.e. OSI PHY Layer 1, the radio frequency medum.

Here is a Semtech's LoRa definition:

_LoRa (Long Range) is a modulation technique that provides significantly longer range than competing technologies.
The modulation is based on spread-spectrum techniques and a variation of [chirp spread spectrum (CSS)][15]
with integrated forward error correction (FEC).
LoRa significantly improves the receiver sensitivity and as with other spread‐spectrum modulation techniques,
uses the entire channel bandwidth to broadcast a signal, making it robust to channel noise
and insensitive to frequency offsets caused from the use of low cost crystals.
LoRa can demodulate signals 19.5dB below the noise floor
while most frequency shift keying systems (FSK) need a signal power
of 8-10dB above the noise floor to demodulate properly.
The LoRa modulation is the physical layer (PHY), which can be utilized with different protocols
and in different network architecture – Mesh, Star, point to point, etcetera._

The LoRa physical layer protocol is closed and proprietary, so there is little documentation
on how the above is really done.
To decode all this, here are additional, much more technical answer To “What Is LoRa?”:

* [High Power LoRa And Tropospheric Reflection Experiments](https://hackaday.com/2020/03/21/high-power-lora-and-tropospheric-reflection-experiments/)

Most of tests performed by Semtech and other companies
show radio range of about 15-20kms (9.3 to 12.5 miles)
in line-of-sight condition (with bandwidth of 125kHz and spreading factor of 12
and probably using a directional antenna).
The range can be greatly vary because of environmental conditions.
Some High Altitude Ballooning experiences have reported range of several hundredths of kilometers
and dense urban area or indoor scenarios, the maximum range is about 2kms (1.2 miles).
[LoRa can even work underground][17].

# What is LoRaWAN?
* https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan

[LoRaWAN][01] (Long Range Wide Area Network) is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN)
specification intended for wireless battery operated Things in regional, national or global network.
It is a media access control (MAC) protocol for long range network
based on [LoRa][01] (Long Range) radio modulation technique.
In the OSI Reference Model, LoRa represent layer 1 (PHY), and LoRaWAN roughly maps to layers 2 and 3.
LoRaWAN networks use a star-of-stars topology in which gateways forward messages between nodes and applications in the backend. Nodes use a single-hop wireless connection to one or more gateways.
http://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/wiki/LoRaWAN/Overview

Building a complete LoRa network or system requires significant development.
LoRa provides the OSI PHY Layer 1 function
but the LoRaWAN must provide OSI layer 2 and above functions.
A large network will need to include gateways, repeaters, addressing,
adaptive data rates, message retries, message acknowledgements, etc.

To address this void, the industry has moved to standardize the MAC features for LoRa
and this standards body is called the [LoRa Alliance][06].
The LoRa Alliance provides a [LoRaWAN Specification][04]
which give more detail on what LoRaWAN really is.
Also, some of the LoRaWAN platform providers,
such as the open source project [LoRaServer][05], have very good documentation
(**NOTE:** these platforms are likely to implement functionality beyond the LoRa Alliance specifications).

To get a sense of where LoRa and LoRaWAN is going,
checkout the video "[Nicolas Sornin - Inventor of LoRa talks about the future of LoRa][18]".

Keep in mind, many companies doing LoRa-based networks that aren’t LoRaWAN complaint.
LoRaWAN is intended for carrier-owned-and-operated public networks.
There are many hardware and network server providers competing in this space,
and deploying a system around LoRaWAN is quite complex.

To get started with LoRa and leverage some of the LoRaWAN concepts
(without full compliance with the specifications),
you could try the [development kit form Multi-Tech Systems][08].

## About DevEUIs
LoRa devices have a unique identifier (DevEUI) that is assigned to the device by the chip manufacturer.
This identifier is used to uniquely identify the device on the network.


## Device Classes
The LoRaWAN specification defines three device types.
All LoRaWAN devices must implement Class A,
whereas Class B and Class C are extensions to the specification of Class A devices
(see more detail [here][20] and [here][21]):

* Class A devices support bi-directional communication between a device and a gateway.
Uplink messages (from the device to the gateway) can be sent at any time (randomly).
The device then offers two receive time windows for the gateway to respond with any downloads.
The next oppertunity for a download will be after the next upload.
* Class B devices extend Class A by adding scheduled
receive windows for downlink messages from the server, the devices periodically open receive windows.
* Class C devices extend Class A by keeping the receive windows open unless they are transmitting.
This allows for low-latency communication but is many times more energy consuming than Class A devices.

## Frequency Bands

## Modulation and Data Rate

## LoRaWAN Architecture
A typical LoRaWAN solution is about enabling low power devices (typically called nodes in the LoRa world)
communicating with a gateway (sometimes called a concentrator that then connects with other gateways
or to a network server to exchange data with application server.
This is discribe further below (more detail [here][19]):

* **Nodes** are endpoint device, such as a sensor or an actuator of some kind.
The node connects to a gateway bi-directional at 0.3 to 50 kbps.
The only other thing that a node needs to have is a LoRa radio, an antenna,
and be smart enough to encrypt and decrypt packets, handle network authentication,
and respect the duty cycle.
* **Gateways** act as a bridge between the nodes and the Internet.
Because of the long range capabilities of LoRa,
a single gateway can theoretically service a very large geographic area
but any given node could be “heard” by multiple gateways.
Nodes don’t intrinsically know when they have been “heard”
(there is no ACK acknowledgments in the communication protocol)
so it is good to have multiple gateways within range.
Gateway have a limited number of channels (typically 8) they can communicate over.
of channels that a gateway has is the number of nodes that it can talk to at once.
To maximize the utilization of these limited channels,
nodes agree to adhere to a duty cycle limitation
(duty cycle is a measure of the fraction of time that a resource is in use,
so 2 seconds of use every 10 seconds, you’re operating at a 20% duty cycle)
* **Network Servers** primary job is to direct packets between gateways and application servers
over the Internet.
Generally, it doesn't concern itself with what is in the packets of data.
It also does all of the behind-the-scenes control / administrative
tasks that makes a LoRaWAN network operate.
The network server also de-duplicate packets coming in from multiple gateways,
since any node might be within range of multiple gateways.
* **Application Servers** are servers that’s connected to the network server
and knows specifically what to do with packets from a given node or type of node.
Where the network server doesn't look at the packet data,
the application server specifical takes actions based on the packet contents.

# HelTec WiFi LoRa 32
For my first foray into the world of LoRa radios is with the
[HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2)][30] using The Thing Network.
My main driver for selecting this device over others was
it's cost of $27 on Amazon (I have seen then as cheap $20),
my fimilarity with the ESP32 + toolchain,
lithium battery port with onboard charger circuit (via USB serial  interface),
it includes a U.FL connected 1/4 wave length antenna and cabling,
and a builtin [OLED display][31] (size is 128x64).
This ESP32 based device has built-in support for WiFi and Bluetooth communication but not for LoRa.
A SX127x LoRa transceiver adds support for LoRa
and the LoRaWAN protocol that are needed for The Things Network.
In addition to the hardware, software is needed for implementing the LoRaWAN protocol.
The [SX1276 LoRa transceiver][32] provides LoRa radio modulation but it does not implement the LoRaWAN protocol.
The protocol has to be implemented in software that needs to run on the ESP32.

* [Three Quick Tips About Using U.FL](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/three-quick-tips-about-using-ufl)

######### UP DATE ##########
There is a dedicated LED (non-programmable) for the battery status.
It is blinking while charging (or no battery connected) and to turn off when battery is full.
It is on when the battery is charged and when no battery is connected, it is off.

I will be creating a single-channel gateway here but these devices would best serve
as LoRaWAN nodes and with the [HelTec HT-M01 LoRa Gateway][33]
(about $170 on [Amazon][34]).

## Background
To fully appreciate all the subtleties of setting up the HelTec devices,
your really should have a rather deep & broad understanding
of radios, radio link engineering, LoRa, LoRaWAN, and all the tools you'll be using.
These video will provide most everything you'll need:

# HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 + LoRaWAN
Andreas Spiess has an excellent [introduction to the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32][37].
He makes the point that the board + antenna is not well engineered
(he prefers the [Hope RFM95][38] and the antennas provided are crap).
Never the less, it's handy for experimenting
since they have multiple communications options, inexpensive, and already assembled.

>**NOTE:** Andreas Spiess has done an [extensive study of LoRa][40] and he recommends
>building your own using the Hope RFM95 with an ESP (eg. Wemos)
>or Arduino (eg. Adafruit Feather 32u4 RFM95 LoRa Radio,
>or LoRa32u4 II 868M 915M Lora Development Board).
>He show how to do this [here][39].

# Heltec ESP32
Verizon 2 so many bugs were fixed and more stable
better impedance matching
flash size of 8Mbytes
voltage limit less than 7V

## Heltec ESP32 LoRa Point-to-Point
There are a few tutorials on how to set LoRa up in a point-to-point configuration.

* [LoRa Is the Network](https://hackaday.com/2017/10/24/lora-is-the-network/)
* [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 – ESP32 with OLED and SX1278](https://robotzero.one/heltec-wifi-lora-32/)
* [ESP32 - LoRa - OLED Module](https://hackaday.io/project/27791-esp32-lora-oled-module)

### Step 1: Attach an Antenna
Make sure to attach an antenna to the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32.

>**WARNING:** Never apply power to the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32
>without first attaching an antenna!!
>Doing so will likely **burn out** the radio chip!

### Step X: Make Terminal Connection - DONE
The HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) comes with some pre-installed software,
and I believe it's the [source codes and toolchain made by HelTec][22].
If you plug-in a USB connection between the device your Linux box, it will power up,
and you see activity on the OLED display.
Using `screen`, you should also see some serial terminal activity as should below:

```bash
# terminal connection to heltec lora 32
$ screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200,cs8

ets Jun  8 2016 00:22:57

rst:0x1 (POWERON_RESET),boot:0x13 (SPI_FAST_FLASH_BOOT)
configsip: 0, SPIWP:0xee
clk_drv:0x00,q_drv:0x00,d_drv:0x00,cs0_drv:0x00,hd_drv:0x00,wp_drv:0x00

load:0x40080000,len:6696
entry 0x400802e4
ESP32ChipID=F4408CBF713C
```

While this shows potential,
I want to start simple and with better documentation.

### Step X: LoRa Sender and Reciever
Instead of using [HelTec's coding examples][22],
I'll follow design patterns found in
[Robot Zero One][23], the [Random Nerd Tutorals][25], and [Fernando Koyanagi][26].
These examples use the [Arduino IDE's LoRa libraries][24] to build a simple point-to-point LoRa radio.

The HelTec code used the [ThingPulse ESP8266 OLED SSD1306][28] display library.
An introduction to this library can be found at "[ESP32 Arduino: Interacting with a SSD1306 OLED display][27]".



### Step X: Get OLED Display Working
The HelTec WiFi LoRA 32 has a built-in
monochrome 0.96" 128x64 pixel OLED graphic display.
It can be addressed like a serial console,
and is very readable due to the high contrast of an OLED display.

You’ll need to install the [U8g2][29], or [Ai_Ardulib_SSD1306][36],
or [Adafruit_SSD1306][35] library, and all can be found in the Arduino IDE library manager.
I choose to install the U8g2, the bigger but more functional library,
via the command:

```bash
# install the U8g2 and LoRa libraries
arduino-cli lib install "U8g2" "LoRa"
```

## Heltec ESP32 + LoRaWAN (Single Channel Gateway)
In this section, we will construct a LoRa Node and Single-Channel LoRaWAN Gateway
(aka 1-Channel LoRa Gateway) that works with the [The Things Network (TTN)][14].
We'll create a LoRa node will connect to the gateway and
the gateway will be connected to The Things Network.
The limitation on this implementation is the gateway
can only listen to one LoRa channel at a time,
unlike full multi-channel LoRa gateways.

We will make use of the [IBM Zurich][42] LMIC (LoraMAC-in-C) library,
specifically created for LoRaWAN MAC on embedded systems.
[IBM's orginal code base][43] has been forked by may.
I considered the fork by [Things4U][44] ([repository here][45])
and HelTec ESP32 tutorial that uses the Aruduino libraries
(one of the three [Arduino-LMIC library][46]).
I choose to use one of the [heavily supported LMIC libraries][47]
and supported by LoRa product developer [MCCI][48].

As to the actual code for the LoRa node & gateway,
I considered using/modified the [code by Vergil Cola][49],
which is his port of Things4U version 5.0 to the Heltec ESP32 Lora platform.
I then discovered that M. Westenberg (developer of Things4U) now supports ESP32 boards,
so I'm going to use [Things4U Single Channel LoRaWAN Gateway][45] as my code base.

For greater insights on the code,

## LoRa Gateway Setup

## Load LoRa Gateway Firmware

### Step 1: Attach an Antenna - DONE
Before you do anything,
make sure to attach an antenna to the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32
so you don't mistakenly burn out your radio.

>**WARNING:** Never apply power to the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32
>(any radio for that matter, for an abundance of caution)
>without first attaching an antenna!!
>Doing so will likely **burn out** the radio chip!

### Step X: Clone and Install Things4U Code - DONE
Next I download the [code from Things4U][53] from GiHub.
This repository comes with its own set of libraries it expects you to install with the Arduino IDE.
I want to move away from the quirkiness of the Arduino IDE to a Makefile,
but before doing so,
I want to first compile the code using Arduino IDE.

It is important to install your libraries in the correct location
(see [Adafruit's write up][54] for some good guidance).
Otherwise the compiler will not be able to locate them
when you try to compile and upload your sketches.
The right location is with the sketchbook libraries folder
(your can find this via starting the Arduino IDE,
select the menu button **File** > **Preferences**).
In my case, this is `~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries/`.

I also notice that some of the [libraries within the Things4U repository][56]
appear to be equivalent the Arduino libraries.
Here is what I discovered:

* **aes** - no equivalent
* **esp32-http-update** - no equivalent (but appears to be port to ESP32 of the OTA firmware updater for ESP8266)
* **ESP8266_Oled_Driver_for_SSD1306_display** - appears to be equivalent to [ThingPulse ESP8266 OLED SSD1306](https://github.com/ThingPulse/esp8266-oled-ssd1306)
* **LoRaCode** - no equivalent
* **Time** - appears to be equivalent to the [Arduino Time Library](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time)
* **ArduinoJson** - appears to be equivalent to [ArduinoJson](https://github.com/bblanchon/ArduinoJson)
* **ESP32WebServer** - no equivalent (but appears to be a port to the ESP32 of the ESP8266WebServer library)
* **gBase64** - no equivalent
* **Streaming** - appears to be equivalent to the [Arduino Streaming Library](https://github.com/janelia-arduino/Streaming)
* **WiFiEsp** - appears to be equivalent to [Arduino WiFi library for ESP8266 modules](https://github.com/bportaluri/WiFiEsp)

So I cloned the github repository for Things4U.
I then manually install the libraries that have
"no equivalent" within the Arduino Libraries
and install the others via `arduino-cli`.
The procedure I used is outlined below:

```bash
# clone the code from Things4U
git clone https://github.com/things4u/ESP-1ch-Gateway-v5.0.git ~/src/lora-1channel

# copy the libraries to your Arduino IDE sketchbooks folder
cd ~/src/lora-1channel/libraries
cp -r aes ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries
cp -r esp32-http-update ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries
cp -r LoRaCode ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries
cp -r ESP32WebServer ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries
cp -r gBase64 ~/src/arduino/sketchbooks/libraries

# make sure you have an updated library index
arduino-cli lib update-index

# search for the names of the libraries, for example
$ arduino-cli lib search streaming | grep Name
Name: "Json Streaming Parser"
Name: "Streaming"

# install the desired libraries
arduino-cli lib install "ArduinoJson@5.13.4"
arduino-cli lib install "Streaming" "WiFiEsp" "Time@1.5.0"
arduino-cli lib install "ESP8266 and ESP32 Oled Driver for SSD1306 display"

# list the libraries you have installed in the Arduino IDE

```

### Step X: Test Compile the Gateway Code - DONE
Without further modifications,
I was able to successfully compile the code
using the Arduino IDE and the `arduino-cli` tools:

```bash
# compile the code
cd ~/src/lora-1channel/ESP-sc-gway
arduino-cli compile -b esp32:esp32:heltec_wifi_lora_32
```

### Step X: Configure the LoRa Radio - DONE
Before loading the ESP32 with the binaries,
I want to make sure the LoRa radio and other things are properly configured
for my radio spectrum and the specifics of the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) board.
For further insights on this topic,
see the references to online documentation and videos at the top of this section.
Particularly important are the instructions in the GitHub [README.md file][55].

#### Update `loraModem.h`
I need to add pinout information for the [HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2)][30].
To support the LoRa radio pinout,
I added the following code to the file `loraModem.h`:

```cpp
#elif _PIN_OUT==6
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
// For HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) - http://www.heltec.cn/project/wifi-lora-32/?lang=en
//
// Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) pinout diagram
// http://www.heltec.cn/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/WIFI-LoRa-32V2-%E5%89%AF%E6%9C%AC.pdf_page_1.png
//
// HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) pinouts - SPI protocol
// GPIO 18 -- SX1278's CS (select)
// GPIO  5 -- SX1278's SCK (SCLK / SCL / CLK / serial clock)
// GPIO 19 -- SX1278's MISO (master in-slave out / data line from the slaves to the master)
// GPIO 27 -- SX1278's MOSI (SDA / master out-slave in / data line from the master to the slaves)
// GPIO 14 -- SX1278's RESET
// GPIO 26 -- SX1278's IRQ (interrupt request)

// HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) OLED pinouts - I2C protocol
// GPIO 17 -- SSD1306's CS (chip select) - your choose
// GPIO 23 -- SSD1306's DC ( D/C / distinguish between commands or data) - your choose
// GPIO 15 -- SSD1306's SCL (SCLK / SCk / CLK / serial clock)
// GPIO  4 -- SSD1306's SDA (MOSI / master out-slave in / data line from the master to the slaves)
// GPIO 16 -- SSD1306's RESET (Some OLED displays do not have it)
#define SCK    5
#define MISO   19
#define MOSI   27
#define RST    14
#define SS     18

struct pins {
	uint8_t dio0 = 26;		// GPIO 26 / Dio0 used for one frequency and one SF
	uint8_t dio1 = 33;		// GPIO 26 / Used for CAD, may or not be shared with DIO0
	uint8_t dio2 = 32;		// GPIO 26 / Used for frequency hopping, don't care
	uint8_t ss =   SS;		// GPIO 18 / Dx. Select pin connected to GPIO18
	uint8_t rst =  RST;     // GPIO  0 / D3. Reset pin not used
} pins;

```

#### Update `oLED.h`
And I added the following code to the `oLED.h` file to support the OLED:

```cpp
#elif _PIN_OUT==6               // For HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 (V2) OLED pinouts - I2C protocol
#define OLED_SCL 15             // GPIO 15 -- SSD1306's SCL
#define OLED_SDA 4              // GPIO  4 -- SSD1306's SDA
#define OLED_RST 16             // GPIO 16 -- SSD1306's RESET (Some OLED displays do not have it)
// GPIO 17 -- SSD1306's CS (chip select) - your choose
// GPIO 23 -- SSD1306's DC ( D/C / distinguish between commands or data) - your choose

```

#### Update `ESP-sc-gway.h`
Within the `ESP-sc-gway.h` file,
make sure the following pre-processor varables are set:

```cpp
// compile time controls
#define DEBUG 1         // debug message, set to 0 for operational use
#define DUSB 1          // basic debug messages to serial
#define _LFREQ 915      // lora radio freq band
#define _SPREADING SF9  // lora radio spreading factor
#define _PIN_OUT 6      // what type of board is being used
#define WIFIMANAGER 0   // configuration through WifiManager AP setup; code currently does NOT support 1 on esp32
#define OLED 2          // what type of OLED display

// The Things Network (TTN) parameters
#define _LOCUDPPORT 1700		        	// UDP port of gateway! Often 1700 or 1701 is used for upstream comms
#define _TTNSERVER "ttn-router-us-west"     // ID of the router your gateway will connect to
//#define _TTNSERVER "router.us.thethings.network"     // ID of the router your gateway will connect to

// gateway ident definitions
#define _DESCRIPTION "test-gway-1-jirland"	   	// name of the gateway
#define _EMAIL "jeffskinnerbox@yahoo.com"    	// owner email
#define _PLATFORM "HelTec WiFi LoRa 32"         // board used for gateway
#define _LAT 39.095852                          // 39°05'45.1"N
#define _LON -77.586528                         // 77°35'11.6"W
#define _ALT 115						    	// altitude in meters

#define GATEWAYNODE 0                           // 1 if gateway has sensor, 0 otherwise
#define _CHECK_MIC 0                            // 1 if gateway has sensors, 0 otherwise

// Application type infomation need only if gateway is also a node (i.e. gateway has sensors)
#if GATEWAYNODE==1
#define _DEVADDR { 0x26, 0x01, 0x01, 0x01 }
#define _APPSKEY { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }
#define _NWKSKEY { 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 }
#define _SENSOR_INTERVAL 300

// For ESP32 based TTGO boards these two are normally included
#define _GPS 0
#define _BATTERY 0
#endif

// ntp time server
#define NTP_TIMESERVER "us.pool.ntp.org"	// Country and region specific
#define NTP_TIMEZONES	5					// How far is our Timezone from UTC (excl daylight saving/summer time)

// define the radio type that you are using
#define CFG_sx1276_radio

// for debug messages to serial momitor and flashing
#define _BAUDRATE 115200
```

Then updated your WiFi credentials in the `ESP-sc-gway.h` file as so:

```cpp
wpas wpa[] = {
	{ "" , "" },		           // reserved for WiFi Manager
	{ "my-ssid", "my-password" },  // home wifi
	{ "", "" }                     // do not use
};
```

### Step X: Semtech vs. TTN Packet Forwarder - DONE
A [packet forwarder][61] is a program running on the LoRa gateway
and forwards RF packets received to a server through a IP/UDP link.
It also receives packets form the server and sends RF packets to the nodes.
It can also send a network-wide GPS-synchronous beacon signal
used for coordinating all nodes of the network.

There are three readily available packet forwarders that TTN supports:
1. [The Things Network Packet Forwarder][70] ([Github][71])
2. [Semtech Packet Forwarder][72] ([Github][73])
3. [The Things Network Multi Protocol Packet Forwarder][74] ([Github][75])

The Things4U code was built with the Semtech forwarder.
This forwarder was the first packet forwarder and [reportedly has several flaws][62]
but is widely used.
The [code from Things4U][53] uses the Semtech forwarder and you might want to
consider replacing it with one of the others.

### Step X: Test Load the HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 - DONE
```bash
# compile the program
arduino-cli compile --fqbn esp32:esp32:heltec_wifi_lora_32

# upload the compile sketch
arduino-cli upload --fqbn esp32:esp32:heltec_wifi_lora_32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 ~/src/lora-1channel/ESP-sc-gway
```

## Establish Your Gateway on The Things Network (TTN)
Next we need to provision our gateway on to The Things Network (TTN).
We have already prepared our device for connecting with TTN
by setting the parameters in the `ESP-sc-gway.h`,
as shown above in Step X.

### Step X: Register Your Application and Gateway - DONE
The first step is to [signed up for a TTN account][57],
which will give you access to the [TTN Console][58].
Once you've logged into the console,
you'll be presented with a screen to register your gateways and applications.
Pick [Applications][60] and enter the required information.
This resulted in the following information:

* Description: `Test application for HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 single channel gateway with a HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 node`
* Application ID: `test-app-1-jirland`
* Handler: `ttn-handler-us-west`
* Collaborators: `jirland`

* Access Keys (default key): `ttn-account-v2.N5EMU4dcnSNvCrFa_SvkNRHGdlvu3J3fANyC7rJnPkA`

Next we register the [gateway][59], giving me the following information:

* Description: `Test application for HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 single channel gateway with a HelTec WiFi LoRa 32 node`
* Gateway ID: `test-gway-1-jirland`
* Frequency Plan: `United States 915MHz`
* Router: `ttn-router-us-west`
* Location: LAT `39.095852` LON `-77.586528`
* Altitude: `115`

* Automatically update gateway: `off`
* Beta Updates: `off`
* Make status public: `yes`
* Make location public: `yes`
* Make owner public: `yes`




## Enabling Build with a Makefile

### Step X: Enabling Makefile
As stated earlier,
this repository comes with its own set of libraries it expects you to install with the Arduino IDE.
I want to move away from the quirkiness of the Arduino IDE to a Makefile.

```bash
ls  | grep ino | grep _ > ~/tmp/junk
cat ~/tmp/junk | sed 's/.ino$/.cpp/' | paste -d ' ' ~/tmp/junk - | sed 's/^/mv /' > ~/tmp/junk1
bash ~/tmp/junk1
```




################################ REMOVE ########################################
At this point I enter the `~/src/lora-1channel/ESP-sc-gway` directory
and hacked the code considerably to get it compile cleanly
on the Arduino IDE and when using [makeEspArduino][50].

* I eliminated the [libraries](https://github.com/vpcola/ESP32SingleChannelGateway/tree/master/libraries)
by using the Arduino libraries (like [Arduino-LMIC library][46])
and pull other files into ESP-sc-gway and ESP-sc-node.
* Appears the code was all developed on the Arduino IDE and would not compile when using the more stringent makeEspArdunio Makefile.
* I used the U8g2 OLED library instead of the SSD1306

Compiled with Arduino IDE, make using makeEspArdunio,
and `arduino-cli compile -b esp32:esp32:heltec_wifi_lora_32`.

### Step X: Install Your Libraries - DONE
You need to install library for the OLED display and the LoRaWAN.

```bash
# make sure you have an updated library index
arduino-cli lib update-index

# search for the lorawan libraries available
$ arduino-cli lib search lorawan | grep Name

# Using Both ESP32 Cores
The ESP32 comes with 2 Xtensa 32-bit LX6 microprocessors: core 0 and core 1.
So, it is dual core.
When we run code on Arduino IDE, by default, it runs on core 1.
What if I wanted to keep everything WiFi related to core0,
while updating the displays was handled by core1,
and make your ESP32 multitasking?

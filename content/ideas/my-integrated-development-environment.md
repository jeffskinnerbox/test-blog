What about Byobu?
Byobu is a GPLv3 open source text-based window manager and terminal multiplexer. It was originally designed to provide elegant enhancements to the otherwise functional, plain, practical GNU Screen, for the Ubuntu server distribution. Byobu now includes an enhanced profiles, convenient keybindings, configuration utilities, and toggle-able system status notifications for both the GNU Screen window manager and the more modern Tmux terminal multiplexer, and works on most Linux, BSD, and Mac distributions.

An integrated development environment (IDE) is a programming environment
that has been packaged as an application program,
typically consisting of a code editor, a compiler, a debugger,
and a graphical user interface (GUI) builder.

* [vim][14] highly customizable editor.
* [Terminator][01]

is a terminal emulator released under General Public License
and is available for GNU/Linux Platform.
The application program lets you use multiple splits and resized terminals,
all at once on a single screen.
The [configuration file][02] `~/.config/terminator/config`
is used to control options not in gnome-terminal `gconf` profiles, or override `gconf` settings.
    * [Getting the most out of Terminator][20]
* [iTerm2][09] is a replacement for the Mac's native Terminal.
As of this writing, it works only Macs, and like Terminator, does split screens, etc.
* [tmux][10] is a terminal multiplexer that allows us to create sessions
that act roughly like terminal windows, create windows that act like tabs,
and create panes that let us split tmux windows horizontally and vertically.
Since multiple people can connect to a tmux session at a time it gives us
the ability to pair on remote machines or even from separate locations.

* TMUX – The Terminal Multiplexer, [Part 1][18] amd [Part 2][19]
* [Screen][04] is a full-screen window manager, with a [rich command set][21], that multiplexes a physical terminal

between several processes, typically interactive shells.
Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition,
several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards
(e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets).
* [vimux = vim + tmux][05] is a integration of these two tools via a [`vim` plugin][06].
Of course this is one of many ways to do this integration.

See [vim + tmux - OMG!Code][03] for a good video on how these two tools can work together.

of iTerm2 window splits.

# Exact-Constraint Design
Exact-Constraint Design
provides you the principles and techniques for desiging precision machines.
Rather than exclusively relying on precision parts, this method shows how to
restrict degrees of freedom by looking at the basic kinematic connections between parts.
This can save using precision rails and bearings only in the places where absolutely necessary.

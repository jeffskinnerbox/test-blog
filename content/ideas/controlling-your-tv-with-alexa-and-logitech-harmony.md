So you want to do the "smart home" thing.
Undoubtedly you could be accuesd of being lazy
for not wanting to get off the couch and flip the light switch.
But it isn’t just about laziness.
I would argue voice control of your things is more natural and most useful while doing other things.
So why not just use the apps on your phone?
After all, that’s what smarthome is intended to do, right?
Why would anyone give up the one-flick convenience of wall switches
for something that takes at least three or four taps to do on your phone?

Enter voice control.
Saying “Alexa, turn on the living room lights”
is way faster and easier than pulling out my phone, unlocking it, going to the Hue app,
and flicking the right switch. And I can do it from anywhere in the house.

# Alexa Smart Home
Amazon advertises that [Amazon Echo][36] [Alexa skills][20]
have been developed for you to support a Smart Home.

>**Definition:** "Smart Home" is the term commonly used to define a residence that has
appliances, lighting, heating, air conditioning, TVs, computers,
entertainment audio & video systems, security, and camera systems that are capable of
communicating with one another and can be controlled remotely by a time schedule,
from any room in the home, as well as remotely from any location in the world by phone or Internet.

To support the Smart Home concept,
Amazon's Alexa provides a set of built-in smart home capabilities,
called [Smart Home Skill API or Smart Home Skills][21],
using the [Alexa Skills Kit][22],
via [Alexa Voice Services][23].
The Smart Home Skills teaches Alexa how to control your Smart Home devices.
These Alexa Skills and the [wide range of compatible devices][24] make up what
Amazon calls the ["Alexa Smart Home"][23].

Update! Our New Alexa Skill Rolling Out Today (March 23)

A few weeks ago we messaged you to let you know that some exciting updates were coming to our Alexa smart home skill at the end of this month. Well, we just got notification that our new skill has been added to the Alexa Skill Store early and will begin rolling out today!

As a friendly reminder, here are some changes that are coming that may require your attention.


Our Smart Home Skill is Getting Smarter

As one of the first smart home skills on Alexa, Yonomi has been making it possible to control your smart home devices and add additional functionality to Alexa's existing smart home prowess for nearly two years.

Over that time, Alexa itself has continued to get smarter and incorporate new smart home features. These smart home features are great for users, and also allow smart home services like Yonomi to provide a better experience than was possible before.

To take advantage of Alexa's latest smart home features, we're excited to tell you that next week we'll releasing a completely updated Yonomi Alexa skill. As part of this update, there are a few changes that may require your attention.


Here's what's new:

Your Yonomi Routines will now appear under "Scenes" in the Smart Home section of your Alexa app, rather than under "Devices", for a more intuitive experience.

You will now be able to add entire Yonomi Routines to your Alexa Routines! Combine the best of Alexa's voice skills with the best of Yonomi into a single voice command.

In addition to these changes, the new update will also remove some of the previous functionality—most notably the ability to directly control devices will no longer be supported by the Yonomi Alexa skill.  Only commands that relate directly to a Yonomi Routine will be understood and completed by our Alexa skill.

When we first started launched our skill, Alexa did not have a wide breadth of smart home integrations. We saw a serious need for a third-party integration that could turn popular devices on and off. Now that the list of smart home devices with native Alexa integrations is exploding, this functionality has become largely redundant.

You will of course still be able to create Routines with your favorite Yonomi-compatible devices and activate and deactivate those using Alexa.


When Will These Changes Take Place?


Today! Current users of our Alexa smart home skill will be transitioned to the new version automatically over the next 24 hours. New users should see the updated version in the Alexa Skill Store over that same time.


What do I need to do?


To prevent any interruption in your Yonomi experience, we recommend setting up new Routines that turn on/off any devices that you frequently control with the Yonomi smart home skill (e.g. Harmony Hub). Every other part of your experience should remain virtually the same, only with added features!

We know this transition may require a bit of learning curve—especially for those of you who have been using Alexa and Yonomi for direct device control for a while, but we feel confident this will be a better experience for all users. If you need help during the transition, please refer to our support channel.

—The Yonomi Team

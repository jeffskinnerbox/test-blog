[Pseudonymization and Anonymization][01] are different in one key aspect.
Anonymization irreversibly destroys any way of identifying the data subject.
Pseudonymization substitutes the identity of the data subject in such a way
that additional information is required to re-identify the data subject.

# Definitions
Encryption – In Cipher systems messages are transformed through the use of a set of unchanging rules or steps called a Cryptographic algorithm and a set of variable Cryptographic keys.
Tokenization – Code systems that rely on Codebooks to transform plaintext into code text.

**Tokenization**, when applied to data security, is the process of substituting
a sensitive data element with a non-sensitive equivalent, referred to as a token,
that has no extrinsic or exploitable meaning or value.
The token is a reference (i.e. identifier) that maps back to the sensitive data through a tokenization system.

**Information Sanitization** is the process of removing sensitive information from a document
or other message (or sometimes encrypting it),
so that the document may be distributed to a broader audience.

**Redaction** is a type of information sanitization where content is blacking out so it isn't legible
or deletion, as in text from a document.

**Data Anonymization** is a type of information sanitization whose intent is privacy protection.
It is the process of either encrypting or removing personally identifiable information from data sets,
so that the people whom the data describe remain anonymous.

**Data Pseudonymization** is a method to substitute identifiable data with a reversible, consistent value.
Contrast this with data anonymization where you distroy the data's ability to be identifiable.

**Tokenization** is a form of pseudonymization.

differential privacy aims to provide means to maximize the accuracy of queries from statistical databases while minimizing the chances of identifying its records.

k-anonymity is a property possessed by certain anonymized data.
A release of data is said to have the k-anonymity property if the information for each person contained in the release cannot be distinguished from at least {\displaystyle k-1} k - 1 individuals whose information also appear in the release.

l-diversity is a form of group based anonymization that is used to preserve privacy in data sets by reducing the granularity of a data representation.
 The l-diversity model is an extension of the k-anonymity model which reduces the granularity of data representation using techniques including generalization and suppression such that any given record maps onto at least k-1 other records in the data.

# De-Anonymization
De-anonymization is a strategy in data mining in which anonymous data is cross-referenced
with other sources of data to re-identify the anonymous data source.

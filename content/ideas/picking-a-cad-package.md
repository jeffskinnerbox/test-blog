# CAD File Interchangeability
Exchanging CAD files between CAD tools can be a big headache.
The Standard for the Exchange of Product model data,
or commonly called [STEP file format][24],

Your 3D printer's g-code is automatically generated by a slicing program such as Cura.is usually used to share 3D models between users with different CAD systems.

### OpenSCAD
[!openscad-logo](https://reposcope.com/media/unknown/none/unknown/openscad.png)
Complex CAD parts can have complex construction to get things like symmetry and parametric sizing to work correctly. It's much more involved than word processing, for example. If you watch an experienced CAD technician work, they will often wipe the entire part and start over so that the right operators are applied at the right part in the construction sequence.
So CAD part design is a lot like programming, so why not use an actual programming language? That way you get the editing and version control of a programming language.

### FreeCAD
[!freecad-logo](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/FreeCAD-logo.svg/1024px-FreeCAD-logo.svg.png)
[FreeCAD][29] has been under development for some time now,
and it offers you a large list of features.
Capabilities are still missing, especially compared to commercial solutions,
and may not be complete enough to use in most production environments,
but it is powerful enough for most hobbyist use, and many smaller workshops.
FreeCAD, like most of its competitors, can use 2D extrusion techniques
to carry out the modelling of solid 3D characters,
but [FreeCAD is also a general purpose parametric 3D CAD modeler][35].
This means you can make use of [constructive solid geometry (CSG)][01]
techniques when modelling, as well as,
import designs from other CAD software application for use or modification on your FreeCAD workspace.

### FreeCAD + CadQuery
Like OpenSCAD, [FreeCAD][09] is a parametric modeler.
FreeCAD is available from Ubuntu repositories
but chances are this stable version will be outdated, and not have the latest features.
To get the last release version use the PPA.
Give my limited rand of use, I choose the Ubuntu supported version:

```bash
# install freecad
sudo apt-get install freecad
```

### CadQuery
[CadQuery][19] (inspired by [jQuery][23])
is a Python based language for building parametric 3D CAD models.
CadQuery is a library, that’s intentionally designed to be usable as a GUI-less library.
This enables its use in a variety of engineering and scientific applications that create 3D models programmatically.
CadQuery is built with FreeCAD ([CadQuery Module for FreeCAD][20]),
and to a lesser extent, Jupyter Notebook as target platforms,
With it, you can build fully parametric models with a very small amount of code.

Like OpenSCAD, CadQuery is an open-source, script based, parametric model generator.
However, [CadQuery claims superiority][22] because:

* it's a more standard scripting language (i.e. Python)
* many more discriptive language featues
* the ability to begin with an existing STEP model, created in a CAD package,
and then add parametric features to it
* scripts require less code to create most objects,
because it is possible to locate features based on the position of other features, workplanes, vertices, etc.
*  CadQuery scripts can build STL, STEP, and AMF faster than OpenSCAD

# OpenSCAD
[OpenSCAD][02] makes use of two main techniques to do its job.
It does [constructive solid geometry (CSG)][01]
and and it does extrusion of 2D outlines to create solid 3D models.
OpenSCAD is a parametric modeler),
using a scripting / description language to discribe the geometric design.
It is not an interactive modeler (aka direct modeler),
so parts can be previewed, but it cannot be interactively selected or modified by mouse in the 3D view.
An OpenSCAD script specifies geometric primitives
(such as spheres, boxes, cylinders, etc.) and
defines how they are modified and combined
(for instance by intersection, difference, envelope combination and [Minkowski sums][03]) to render a 3D model.
For more insights, see ["What’s the Difference Between Parametric and Direct Modeling?"][07]
and ["Top 8 of the best parametric modeling software"][08].

The greatest advantages of OpenSCAD is the fact that it's
[truely free, widely used, powerful yet simple to use/learn][21].
OpenSCAD gives you (the designer) full control over the modeling process via its scripting language.
This enables you to easily change any step in the modeling process
or make designs that are defined by configurable parameters.
Along with its CGS modeling techniques,
OpenSCAD also supports extrusion of 2D outlines
and it read design parameters from [DXF files][04].
Besides DXF files OpenSCAD,
can read and create 3D models in the [STL file][05] and [OFF file][06] formats.

## OpenSCAD Libraries
OpenSCAD uses three library locations,
the installation library (location is `/usr/share/openscad/libraries/MCAD/`),
the built-in library (location is `$HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/`),
and user defined libraries (location is set by environment variable `OPENSCADPATH`).
In Linux, you can set the `OPENSCADPATH` by adding the following to your profile.
For me, this is `export OPENSCADPATH=$HOME/cad/openscad_libs`.

When you specify a non-fully qualified path and file name in the
OpenSCAD statements `use <...>` or `include <...>`,
OpenSCAD looks for the file in the following directories in the following order:

* the directory of the calling `.scad` file
* the User-Defined library paths (i.e. `OPENSCADPATH`)
* the Built-In library
* the Installation library

In the case of a library file themself's making use of the statements `use <...>` or `include <...>`,
the directory of the library `.scad` file is the 'calling' file
(i.e. when looking for libraries within a library,
it does not check the directory of the top level `.scad` file).

### Special Variables in OpenSCAD
Special variables provide an alternate means of passing arguments to modules and functions within OpenSCAD.
All user, or OpenSCAD, defined variables starting with a '$' are special variables
(similar to special variables in Lisp).

The $fa, $fs and $fn special variables control the number of facets used to generate an arc:

* **$fa is the minimum angle for a fragment.** Even a huge circle does not have more fragments than 360 divided by this number. The default value is 12 (i.e. 30 fragments for a full circle). The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.
* **$fs is the minimum size of a fragment.** Because of this variable very small circles have a smaller number of fragments than specified using $fa. The default value is 2. The minimum allowed value is 0.01. Any attempt to set a lower value will cause a warning.
* **$fn is usually 0.** When this variable has a value greater than zero, the other two variables are ignored and full circle is rendered using this number of fragments. The default value is 0.

## Installing OpenSCAD and Setting Up Libraries
* [Try NopSCADlib For Your Next OpenSCAD Project](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/15/try-nopscadlib-for-your-next-openscad-project/)

**NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE**

[OpenSCAD release: 2019.05](http://www.openscad.org/news.html#20190518)
and install instructions are give [here](http://www.openscad.org/downloads.html)
but [appear to be OpenSCAD version 2015.03-2](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1027731/how-to-install-openscad-in-ubuntu-18-04-18-10).

So as of June 25, 2019, Ubuntu 18.10 support of OpenSCAD 2019.05 hasn't happen yet.

### Step 1: Installing OpenSCAD Executable - DONE
On most Linux distributions,
OpenSCAD isn't the most recent distribution
(version 2019.05 at the time of writing this)
For Ubuntu, you can assure you have latest release of OpenSCAD
by [adding the PPA before installing OpenSCAD][28].

Before adding this repository, lets see why it isn't automatically updating to the latest version.
For Debian systems such as Ubuntu, you could use the command
`grep ^[^#] /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*`
to list the repositories that are used when you update your system.
This command selects sources from the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file and `/etc/apt/sources.list.d`
directory on the system where this information is maintained.
To look for OpenSCAD specifically,
use `grep openscad /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/sources.list.d/*`.

One thing you might notice when looking at the listing above is the use of the terms
restricted, universe, and multiverse. These terms identify some important distinctions:

* **Main –** officially supported, open-source software.
Canonical provides official support for these packages.
Every open-source software package included in the default installation is included
along with some other important packages.
* **Restricted –** officially supported, closed-source software – e.g.,
hardware drivers -- supported for the length of the release.
* **Universe –** community-maintained, open-source.
The majority of the Ubuntu software comes from this repository.
Canonical does not provide official support or updates.
* **Multiverse –** unsupported, closed-source and patent-encumbered software.

To [install OpenSCAD in Ubuntu 18.10][45]:

```bash
# add the openscad ppa
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openscad/releases

# update your repository list
sudo apt-get update

# install openscad
sudo apt-get install openscad

# check the version of openscad install
$ openscad --version
OpenSCAD version 2015.03-2
```

### Step X:
This Linux package install only brings in the the installation library
(located at `/usr/share/openscad/libraries/MCAD/`).
The [OpenSCAD MCAD Library][15] ([documentation][16])
contains components commonly used in designing and moching up mechanical designs.

Next we'll install some additional libraries.

### Step X: Installing OpenSCAD Libraries
There are many other OpenSCAD libraries you could choose to install,
many of which can be found [listed here][17] and [listed here][18].

Others that I have come accross that may be of some general use are:

* In mechanical engineering, a fillet is a rounding of an interior or exterior corner of a part design. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fillet_(mechanics)   https://github.com/StephS/i2_xends/blob/master/inc/fillets.scad
* [Belfry OpenScad Library](https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL/wiki)


In all cases, the best pratice is to install them on the
User-Defined library path (i.e. `OPENSCADPATH`).
I choose to install the following:

```bash
# setup your environmental variables
echo "export OPENSCADPATH=$HOME/cad/openscad_libs" >> $HOME/.bashrc

# change directory to install location
mkdir -p $HOME/cad/openscad_libs
cd $HOME/cad/openscad_libs

# download 'nuts and bolts' libraries - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:965737/files
mkdir $HOME/cad/openscad_libs/nuts_and_bolts
cd $HOME/cad/openscad_libs/nuts_and_bolts
wget https://www.thingiverse.com/download:1525888 -O threads.scad
wget https://www.thingiverse.com/download:1545313 -O nuts_and_bolts_v1.95.scad
```

## Workbenches
The first key concept to understand about freecad is the notion of workbenches.
A workbench is a collection of tools that make it easy to realize a task.
You can select a workbench through
the drop down menu in the middle of the icon bar.
For 3D printing, you will mostly use the **Part Design** and the **Part** workbenches.

### A2plus Workbench
The A2plus workbench is an [external workbench][27] to assemble different parts in FreeCAD.

### Gear Workbench
* [Home Made Gears Save This Shredder](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/23/home-made-gears-save-this-shredder/)

### Step 1: Install FreeCAD - DONE
Installing via `apt-get` on Ubuntu gives you an older version of FreeCAD
(dating back to 2016, [version 0.16][38]).
The [FreeCAD community maintaines a PPA repository][30]
for a stable releases of FreeCAD
that more up to date than those found on the Ubuntu repositories.
Unfortanately, I had problems using this.

>**NOTE:** When installing FreeCAD with `sudo apt-get install freecad`,
>on startup, FreeCAD displays the error message "No module named WebGui"
>and shows little except a grey screen and a menu bar.
>It doesn't look anything like its [start screen][31]
>as [advertised in the documentation][32].
>There appears to be a [kludgy fix][33] but the [official work around][34]
>is to select **View** > **Workbench** > **Complete**.

The [FreeCAD download page][39] recommends an alternative,
that being an [AppImage][40].

```bash
# download the FreeCAD AppImage to a directory in your PATH
# download site = https://freecadweb.org/downloads.php
cd ~/bin
wget https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/download/0.17/FreeCAD-0.17.13541.9948ee4.glibc2.17-x86_64.AppImage

# make the download an executable and create a symbolic link
chmod a+x FreeCAD-0.17.13541.9948ee4.glibc2.17-x86_64.AppImage
ln -s FreeCAD-0.17.13541.9948ee4.glibc2.17-x86_64.AppImage freecad

# check the version = FreeCAD 0.17 Revision: 13541 (Git)
freecad --version
```

When you start FreeCAD for the first time via the commandline,
you'll be asked if you want to integrate it into your system.
The answer is "yes" to support desktop integration.

>**NOTE:** Wehn I first started FreeCAD, I got the error message
>"Gtk-Message: 10:19:29.865: Failed to load module 'overlay-scrollbar'".
>I [fixed this][42] with
>`sudo apt-get install --reinstall overlay-scrollbar overlay-scrollbar-gtk2`.

>**NOTE:** If you choose to [delete the AppImage file][41],
>the desktop files remain in your system.
>You may leave it as it is but it might be wiser to delete them manually.

### Step 2: Install the CadQuery Module for FreeCAD - DONE
[CadQuery][43] is a Python based language for building parametric 3D CAD models.
CadQuery can be used as a scripting language within FreeCAD.
[CadQuery is supported in FreeCAD as a module (aka workbench)][44]
and all of the required libraries are embedded with the workbench.

To install CadQuery,
run the FreeCAD Addon Manager by clicking **Tools** > **Addon manager** > **cadquery_module**.

### Step X:
### Step X:


### Step X: PartDesign Workbench
The main concept behind the FreeCAD interface is that it is separated into workbenches.
A workbench is a collection of tools suited for a specific task,
such as working with meshes, or drawing 2D objects, or constrained sketches.
You can switch the current workbench with the workbench selector.
You can customize the tools included in each workbench,
add tools from other workbenches or even self-created tools (called macros).
Widely used starting points are the [Sketcher Workbench][37], [PartDesign Workbench][38].

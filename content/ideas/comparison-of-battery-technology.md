################################################################################



If your project is to be portable,
you'll need a battery pack!
Readily available are the use-once alkaline batteries, such as the venerable AA or 9V cell.
They are good for making larger multi-battery packs, easy to find, and carry plenty of charge.
If you want rechargeable batteries to save money and avoid waste,
Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries can often replace alkalines.
The latest technology for rechargeables are the lithium ion and polymer batteries.
There is actually [many more types of batteries][06] but these three are the most popular.

A [primary cell][03] is a battery that is designed to be used once and discarded,
and not recharged with electricity and reused like a secondary cell (rechargeable battery).
A typical primary batteries is intended for long periods of storage
and have a lower self-discharge rate than a rechargeable battery.
A [secondary cell][04] (aka rechargeable battery, storage battery, or accumulator)
is a type of electrical battery which can be charged, discharged into a load, and recharged many times.
Secondary cells typically have an initially cost more than primary batteries,
but have a much lower total cost of ownership and environmental impact,
as they can be recharged inexpensively many times before they need replacing.

Definitions
C-Rating - http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/what_is_the_c_rate

# Alkaline Batteries
[Alkaline batteries][05] are a type of primary cell and highly popular for everyday home and indurtial use.

* The amount of current an alkaline battery can deliver is roughly proportional to its physical size.
* The nominal voltage of a fresh alkaline cell is 1.5 to 1.65 V.
The average voltage under load depends on level of discharge and the amount of current being drawn,
varying from 1.1 to 1.3 V.
* The fully discharged cell has a remaining voltage in the range of 0.8 to 1.0 V.
* Shelf Life: 5 years for alkaline batteries

# Rechargeable Alkaline Batteries
[Rechargeable Alkaline battery (RAM)][02] are available.
Their main advantage over other rechargeable batteries is their ability to hold a charge
and the fact that they are less expensive.
They are manufactured fully charged and have the ability to hold their charge for years,
longer than NiCd and NiMH batteries, which self-discharge.
Their major disadvantage is that they have a limited number of charging cycles,
particularly if they undergo a deep discharge.

# Nickel-Metal Hydride Batteries
A [Nickel–Metal Hydride battery (NiMH or Ni–MH)][01], is a type of rechargeable battery.

* Shelf Life: self-discharge rate is over 30% per month for common NiMH batteries
dropping to about 2% to 3% per month for low self-discharge NiMH batteries

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_effect

# Lithium-ion Batteries
* [Li-Ion & LiPoly Batteries](https://learn.adafruit.com/li-ion-and-lipoly-batteries)
* [Better Battery Management Through Chemistry](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/07/better-battery-management-through-chemistry/#more-377655)
* [Protect Your Batteries Before You Wreck Your Batteries](https://hackaday.com/2019/10/30/protect-your-batteries-before-you-wreck-your-batteries/)

http://www.digikey.com/en/articles/techzone/2012/sep/a-designers-guide-to-lithium-battery-charging

* [Chemistry Nobel Goes to Lithium Battery Innovators](https://www.quantamagazine.org/chemistry-nobel-goes-to-lithium-battery-innovators-20191009/)

[Lithium-ion batteries][10] are common in home electronics
because of their high [energy density][14], [specific energy][15],
tiny [memory effect][11] and low [self-discharge][12].
They have one of the highest energy density and specific energy(360 to 900 kJ/kg) among rechargeable batteries.
Their downside is that they need very spcific proceedure when charging them.

A [lithium-ion polymer battery][13] (aka lithium polymer, LiPo,LiPoly,  LIP, Li-poly)
is a rechargeable battery of lithium-ion technology in a pouch format.
Lithium-ion polymer cells tend to be thin rectangles in a silvery bag.
They are soft-shelled and have an easy to damage casing.
They often weigh a little less and come in smaller capacity.

## Voltages
Depending on the design and chemistry of your lithium cell,
you may see them sold under different nominal voltages.
Almost all lithium polymer batteries are 3.7V or 4.2V batteries.
What this means is that the maximum voltage of the cell is 4.2v
and that the "nominal" (average) voltage is 3.7V.
As the battery is used, the voltage will drop lower and lower.
Once you hit 3.4V the battery is consided dead
and at 3.0V the protective cutoff circuitry disconnects the battery.
You should see the number 3.7V written on the battery itself somewhere.

**NOTE:** You may also run across 4.1V/3.6V batteries.
These are older than 4.2V/3.7V - they use a
slightly different chemistry and you'll see the 3.6V marking on the cell.
Nowadays you may also be able to purchase 4.35V cells!
These are the latest chemistry, they have a little more power as indicated
by the voltage being higher than 4.2V.
They tend to be cylinder lithium ion's used for laptop batteries, and lights.
Make sure when you're buying batteries and chargers to match them up!
Overcharging a 3.6V battery by attaching it to a 4.2V battery charger
can at the very least permanently damage your battery and at worst cause a fire!

## Protective Circuity
Lithium ion/polymer batteries are extremely power dense.
This makes them great for reducing size and weight of projects.
However, they are not 'safe' batteries and require extra care.
Under certain conditions, some battery chemistries and Lithium is one of them,
are at risk of [thermal runaway][07], leading to cell rupture or combustion.
Thermal runaway is a situation where an increase in temperature changes
the chemical conditions causing a further increase in temperature,
sometimes leading to a destructive heating or fire.

A circuit board attached to the battery can monitor the battery voltage and
the current going out.
These are often referred to simply as protection circuits.
They are very common on standard batteries but you must check the datasheet
or product image to verify that a protection circuit is attached
On Adafruit's lithium ion/ployer batteries,
a protection circuit is soldered onto the battery
and then taped into the little cavity at the top of the battery.
This is very common for lipoly cells and generally provide the following protection:

* Assures they are not charge them above their maximum safe voltage (say 4.2V)
* Assures not to discharge them below their minimum safe voltage (say 3.0V)
of by any on-cell protection circuit
* Do not draw more current than the battery can provide (say about 1-2C)
taken care of by any on-cell protection circuit
* Do not charge them with more current than the battery can take (say about 1C)

Battery chargers will generally will not charge the batteries
above or below certain temperatures (usually about 0-50 degrees C).
This is not often not an issue as long as the charge rate is reasonable.

## Power Capability
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8hTQXqURB4
https://learn.adafruit.com/all-about-batteries/power-capacity-and-power-capability

## RC Type Batteries
The about discription is for regular/normal lithium ion batteries
are what you find in your ipod, camcorder, phone etc.
They are meant to last for over 500 charges, stay safe,
and provide a C or two of current.
RC lithium ion batteries are meant for radio controlled cars, planes, UAVs, quad copters, etc.
They are meant to give a lot of power at once, up to 20C
and are designed to never 'cut off'
so that the battery will be damaged instead of having the plane fall out of the sky.
RC batteries are often raw cells: There are two tabs coming out of the top and
you'll see its labeled a high C rating (like 20C) for high current output capacity.
They are often less expensive because there is no protection circuitry.



* LiPo cell depends on its chemistry and varies from about 2.7-3.0 V (discharged) to about 4.20-4.35 V (fully charged)
* Shelf Life: self discharge of 2% to 3% per month

## LiIon/LiPoly Charging

[charger!](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/970x728/259-01.jpg)
The [Adafruit Lithium Ion and Lithium Polymer battery charger][09] is based on the [MCP73833 chip][08].
It is specifically engineered for charging single Lithium Ion/Lithium Polymer 3.7/4.2v batteries
and **not for older 3.6/4.1v cells**.
A particularly nice feature is that you don't have to remove the battery form its load for charging.
It also 3 has three indicator LEDs - one for power,
one for charging status and a third that indicates when charging is complete.

**Note:** Never charge a LiPo battery faster than 1C
(so a 1300mAh battery should be charged at under 1300 mA)
and it is generally suggested staying at or below 0.5C.
Check the datasheet of the battery for more information about your cell.

**Note:** Most chargers don't come with temperature sensors built
in because they are not always right next to your battery, or they are intended to be used at
low charge rates and indoors where the temperature is around 25 degrees C.
If you want to charge your batteries at high rates (above 0.5C) or outdoors,
you should get a temperature-based charging solution.

For LiPo battery packs with cells connected in series, a specialised charger may monitor the charge on a per-cell basis so that all cells are brought to the same state of charge (SOC).

## Building a Lithium Ion Battery Charger
## Repurposing Lithium Ion Cells
You may want to reuse lithium-ion batteries from discarded equipment.
These cells are often charged inside the equipment
and there is no separate charger that can be reused.
It is fairly easy to build a charger for used (or new) lithium-ion cells
and Maxim has app note 5681 on this topic:

# DC/DC Boost Converter
A [boost converter][18] (step-up converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter steps up voltage
from its input (supply) to its output (load).
It is a class of [switched-mode power supply (SMPS)][16]
containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor)
and at least one energy storage element, a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination.

https://www.adafruit.com/products/2030

# DC/DC Buck Converter
A [buck converter][17] (step-down converter) is a DC-to-DC power converter
which steps down voltage (while stepping up current) from its input (supply) to its output (load).

https://www.crowdsupply.com/electronut-labs/snapvcc

# Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)
Adafruit [PowerBoost 1000C Charger][19] is a DC/DC boost converter module
that can be powered by any 3.7V LiIon/LiPoly battery,
and convert the battery output to 5.2V DC for running your 5V projects.
Best of all, it has built-in load-sharing battery charger circuit.
So it will automatically switch over to the USB power when available,
instead of continuously charging/draining the battery,
making it a Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS).

## Self Discharge
Much attention can be paid to extending battery life through the use of
low-power semiconductors, communication protocols,
and minimizing the time a device spends in “active’ mode.
However, for very long running applications,
these energy-saving techniques cannot equal the amount of energy lost to
annual battery self-discharge, which often approaches the total amount of energy used to operate the device.

Power sources alkaline batteries are ill-suited for long term deployments,
suffering from very high annual self-discharge rates that exhaust their capacity in 2-3 years or less.
Conversely, bobbin-type Lithium-thionyl chloride (LiSOCl2) batteries
are preferred for long-term deployments due to their
high energy density, high capacity, high voltage (3.6 V),
and an incredibly low annual self-discharge rate that permits up to 40-year battery life.

# Smart Battery System
Smart Battery System (SBS) is a specification for managing a smart battery, usually for a portable computer. It allows operating systems to perform power management operations via a smart battery charger based on remaining estimated run times by determining accurate state of charge readings.

# Battery Degradation
A useful why to think about a batterys degradation or age
in terms of present capacity versus original (new) capacity.

A useful battery has predictable behavior; it can supply a constant amount of power, for a predictable amount of time, within a narrow voltage range. The ‘capacity’ or ‘C rating’ for batteries is probably the most useful parameter to express this.

# Supercapacitors
A [supercapacitor][30], also called an ultracapacitor,
is a high-capacity capacitor with a capacitance value much higher than other capacitors,
but with lower voltage limits,
that bridges the gap between electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries.
It typically stores 10 to 100 times more energy per unit volume or mass than electrolytic capacitors,
can accept and deliver charge much faster than batteries,
and tolerates many more charge and discharge cycles than rechargeable batteries.

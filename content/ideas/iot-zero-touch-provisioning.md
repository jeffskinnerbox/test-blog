Zero touch provisioning (ZTP) is device managmenet feature that allows
the devices to be provisioned and configured automatically,
eliminating most of the manual labor involved with adding them to a network.
ZTP allows the hardware to be installed directly into the environment
and for that act to be the last hands-on moment.
This is achieved through the use of automatic provisioning and configuration systems within the design of the device and is aimed at reducing the workload and effort typically required when installing and configuring new devices.

When device is powered on, it sends out a request through
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
or TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
to get the location of its centrally stored image and configuration, which it downloads and runs.

ZTP automates steps like updating firmeware / operating systems,
deploying patches and bug fixes and implementing added features prior to connection.
Through a user-provided script,
ZTP can connect to a configuration management platform such as Puppet,
CFEengine or Chef or a custom tool.

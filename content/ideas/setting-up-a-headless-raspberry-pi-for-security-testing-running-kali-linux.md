## WiFi Channels
Selecting the proper WiFi channel can significantly improve your WiFi coverage and performance.
In the 2.4 GHz band, [1, 6 and 11 are the only non-overlapping channels][01],
and many wireless routers automatically select the channel for you upon initial setup.
where depending on your wireless environment,
it could lead to slow WiFi speeds and interference.

## WiFi Scanning
https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/152007/why-do-wifi-devices-broadcast

WiFi scanning is one of the basic functions in a wireless network.
It is the mechanism by which a client device (e.g. computer)
or an application discovers the wireless networks that are in range of the WiFi adapter.
As part of this process, application gathers information about the
signal strength, channel, security configuration, and capabilities of nearby networks.
Client devices use this information to determine which networks they can join or roam to.

There are two methods to perform WiFi scanning: active and passive.

* During an **active scan**, the client device searches for wireless networks
by transmitting probes and listening for responses from the access points in range.
These responses describe the configuration and capabilities of each of the
wireless networks managed by the access point.
* During a **passive scan**, the client device listens for beacons,
which are specific frames transmitted by the access points to announce their presence and,
similarly to a probe response,
also include the configuration and capabilities of the wireless networks they service.
A client device must listen on a channel long enough to catch a beacon from a nearby access point
(A default of 10 beacons per second is typical).

An active scan is the recommended mechanism for fast connection establishment
and supported by basically all the WiFi drivers.
But active scanning has a few disadvantages.
First, this method cannot be used, in general,
to find wireless networks that do not broadcast
their SSID (also known as hidden networks),
and second, it may result in shorter scan ranges because
client devices usually transmit at lower power levels.
As a consequence, access points that are located farther away
cannot decode the probes and will not send a response to the client.

Alternatively, a passive scan allows you to find all networks,
including those that are hidden and located at farther distances
(contrary to client devices, access points usually transmit at higher power levels).
Passive scanning requires specific capabilities from the WiFi driver and some extra coding.
For example, the driver must have the ability to put the WiFi interface in
[monitor mode][05] (more on this below)
and provide a mechanism to supply additional information about the frames,
such as the signal strength at which the frames are being received from the access point.
WiFi scanners doing a passive scan would need to
(somehow) iterate over the different supported channels, listen for beacons,
and extract additional information from specialized frame headers
that are used by the WiFi driver to pass information to user-space applications.

## WiFi Modes
A WiFi network device always operates in one
(or for some special hardware, multiple modes as in AP+STA or WDS with AP Mode)
of the six modes that 802.11 wireless cards can operate in:

1. Master / Access Point - acting as an access point (AP)
1. Managed / Station / STA / Access Point Client / Wireless Client / Client - act as a client to an access point
1. Ad-Hoc / Point-to-Point / Wireless Bridge - directly connecting two or more computers without an access point
1. Mesh / Point-to-Multipoint / Multi-point Bridge - decentralized interconnection with other wireless access points
1. Repeater / WDS - wireless interconnection to other access points to form a single managed network
1. Monitor - passively read packets, no packets are transmitted

Strictly speaking, Infrastructure Mode is not a device mode but a concept.

## WiFi Monitor and Promiscuous Modes
The Ethernet and WiFi data is broadcasted to all who wish to listen on a wire or in the air
but only "marked" to be processed by the intended receiver.
The packets sent are are not constrained to reach a specific device, unlike with switched LANs.
This allows for two types of listening in: **Monitor mode** and **Promiscuous mode**.
Monitor mode only applies to wireless networks,
while promiscuous mode can be used on both wired and wireless networks.
Monitor mode is one of the six modes that 802.11 wireless cards can operate in:
Master (acting as an access point), Managed (client, also known as station),
Ad-hoc, Mesh, Repeater, and Monitor mode.

* **Monitor mode:** Sometimes called "rfmon mode", sniffs the packets in the air
without connecting (associating) with any access point.
No association to access point (and no authentication) means your presence is unknown,
your not connected to a network, you can't process the Ethernet information.
This also means the NIC does not care whether the CRC values are correct for packets captured in monitor mode,
so some packets that you see may in fact be corrupted.
In addition, monitor mode allows you to find hidden SSIDs.
SSIDs aren't broadcast by the AP, but they are broadcast by the client.
* **Promiscuous mode:** Sniffing the packets after connecting to an access point.
This is likely what you need to be in if you want to analyze packets (Wireshark, tcpdump, etc.).
In promiscous mode, everything specific to WLAN is hidden from the monitoring tool.
So you only get to see packets that were succesfully decrypted.
In promiscuous mode, you will not see packets until you have associated.
Not all wireless drivers support promiscuous mode.

Important differences between Monitor and Promiscuous modes:

* Promiscuous mode tell the card to _process all frames_,
(i.e. remove 802.11 frame headers) including those not destined for it.
But, monitor mode tells the card to _pass along the frames_ intact (with 802.11 headers)
and not present plain old Ethernet frames.
* In monitor mode, the SSID is not filtered so all packets of all SSID's
from the currently selected channel are captured.
When in promiscuous mode, an 802.11 adapter will only supply packet
for the host of the SSID the adapter has joined.
Although it can receive, at the radio level, packets on other SSID's,
it will not forward them to the host.
* So in order to capture absolutely all traffic from all access points that the adapter can receive,
the adapter must be put into monitor mode.
In this mode, the driver will not be able to sending any traffic
and will only supply received packets to a local storage capture mechanism.
Also this means that the machine will not be able to use that adapter
to resolve addresses to host names using a network protocol such as DNS
or any other such network services.

With some hardware, it is possible to have a network device in monitor mode while in one of the other modes.
This is useful to observe the network whilst using it.
However, not all hardware fully supports this.

Command to put Wireless card in monitor mode on Linux:

```bash
# put wireless adaptor in monitoring mode
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

## Packet Injection
It may also be possible to transmit packets in [monitor mode][05],
which is known as [packet injection][60] (aka [RadioTap][61]).
Most wireless attacks require that you be able to inject packets into the AP while,
at the same time, capturing packets going over the air.
**VERY** few wireless cards are capable of doing this.

As you can imagine, wireless adapter manufacturers are
**NOT** looking to add features to their standard wireless adapters to suit hacker needs.
Most wireless adapters built into your laptop are designed for standard applications.
If we can't inject packets into the AP (in Aircrack-ng, this is the function of Aireplay-ng),
then it really limits what we do from a penetration testing prospective.

# Kali Penetration Testing Tools
A penetration test, aka pen test, is an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system,
generally performed by security evaluation professional.
There are some [popular tools][02] these professional hackers typically use,
but there is also the [Kali][03] Linux distribution that contain them and many more
(over 600 pre-installed penetration-testing and utility programs).
Kali Linux has not only become the information security professional's platform of choice,
but has evolved into an industrial-grade and world-class
operating system distribution in its own right.

## Kali Platform Install
Kali Linux is a Debian-derived Linux distribution designed for digital forensics and penetration testing.
The version I installed was version 2018.3 (i.e. [Kali Linux RPi - kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img.xz][19]).

### Step 1: Kali System Physical Design - DONE
For my Kali Linux hardware platform,
I used a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B][09] which has quad core ARMv7 processor, and 1 Gigabyte of RAM.
This isn't the [most powerful Raspberry Pi][14],
but appears perfectly acceptable for the capabilities required by Kali.
I also "dressed" it in a Kali-suitable [black, metal case][10].
This Pi doesn't have internal WiFi or Bluetooth radios (like the RPi 3 or RPi Zero W)
but this isn't desirable anyway.
I want [full control over the capabilities of the WiFi adapter][26]
to make sure Kali can perform its full range of capabilities.

To perform penetration testing with Kali Linux,
your WiFi adapter must be capable of [packet Injection][60] and [monitor mode][05].
There are WiFi chipsets that could be capable of Pen Test
but the available drivers don't give them this ability.
So its very important to pick the right adapter.
Check out these article to help select a WiFi adapter:

For my **Wireless Attack Dongle**,
I choose the [Alfa AWUS036ACH][26] with its dual antennas and dual band technology
(2.4 GHz 300 Mbps/5 GHz 867 Mbps) supports 802.11ac and a, b, g, n.
This device has the RTL8812AU wireless chipsets but the drivers are not part of the standard Linux kernel.
Due to popular demand, [the drivers have been modified to allow for injection][04].
I could have also use the tried and true [Edimax EW-7811Un is a Wireless-N dongle][08] WiFi radio.
This works very well with the Raspberry Pi and is supports the Kali suite of tools
but doesn't have much gain / range.

For my **Wireless Command & Control (C2) Dongle**
Im using the [Edimax EW-7811Un is a Wireless-N dongle][08].
The purpose of the C2 wireless dongle is to connect via WiFi to your access point,
assuming you choose not to use a wired Ethernet connection.

### Step 2: Download Kali Image - DONE
Before you can load a copy of the latest version of Kali on your Raspberry Pi,
you must first download the official operating system from [here][06] and [here][07].

The Raspbian download site also lists a check sum for the download file.
Check whether the file has been changed from its original state
by checking its digital signature (SHA256 hash value)
amd then compress the file to retrieve the image.

```bash
# validate file is uncorrupted via check of digital signature
 $ sha256sum kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img.xz
1bcc4b3a1699417baeaebf7a37213898f988987e564283ed0eb7da94b47fcca6  kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img.xz

# uncompress the image file from its conpressed state
xz --decompress kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img.xz

# check the size of the files
$ ls -l
total 4237888
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jeff jeff 4718592000 Sep  2 11:59 kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img
```

### Step 3: Write Kali Image to SD Card - DONE
Next using Linux, you have copied the Kali image onto the SD card mounted to your system.
I'll be using the [Rocketek 11-in-1 4 Slots USB 3.0 Memory Card Reader][11] to create my SD Card.
Make sure to [choose a reputable SD Card][12] from [here][13], don't go cheap.

When using your card reader,
you'll need to know the device name of the reader.
The easiest way to find this is just unplug your card reader from the USB port,
using a Linux machine (in my case Ubuntu 18.04.1)
run `df -h`, then plug it back in, and run `df -h` again.

```bash
# with the SD card reader unplugged
$ df -h

In my case, the SD Card already contains an old Linux image.
Now lets write the Kali image to the SD Card and check its integrity:

```bash
# go to directory with the RPi image
cd /home/jeff/Downloads

# unmount the sd card reader
sudo umount /dev/sdj1 /dev/sdj2

# write the image to the sd card reader
sudo dd bs=4M if=kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img of=/dev/sdj

# ensure the write cache is flushed
sudo sync

# check the integrity of the sd card image - diff should state they are the same
# this could take over an hour but it gives you assurance that you got a good SD card image
sudo dd bs=4M if=/dev/sdj of=copy-from-sd-card.img
sudo truncate --reference kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img copy-from-sd-card.img
diff -s kali-linux-2018.3-rpi.img copy-from-sd-card.img

# clean up
rm  copy-from-sd-card.img

# unmount the sd card reader
sudo umount /dev/sdj
```

### Step 3: Installing SSH on Kali at First Boot - DONE
I want to do a headless installation of Kali Linux on the Raspberry Pi.
Why?  I don't have conveniently on-hand a spare monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
With the Raspberry Pi's standard Raspian OS,
I can configure the SD Card such that on [first boot you are given SSH headless access][15].

One thought on a possible way this is to set a static IP address for the Raspberry Pi before first boot.
You could connect the Pi directly to a laptop or desktop computer
with a [Ethernet crossover cable][21]
(I happened to use a [crossover adapters][23] and a patch cable.
See "[Raspberry Pi Remote Connections – Without A Network!][16]" for more information..
But you will still not have SSH or `telenet` enabled,
and so, you will need a monitor & keyboard.

>**NOTE:** An [Ethernet crossover cable][21] is a cable for connecting computing devices together directly.
>Within the cable, internal wiring is crossed over such that transmit signals at one end
>is connected to the receive signals at the other end.
>It is most often used to connect two devices of the same type:
>e.g. two computers (via their network interface controllers) or two switches to each other.
>By contrast, patch cables or straight through cables are used to connect devices of different types,
>such as a computer to a network switch or Ethernet hub.
>Some devices today support [auto MDI-X][21] capability,
>wherein a patch cable can be used in place of a crossover cable, or vice versa,
>and the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured
>automatically within the devices to yield this desired result.
>It isn't clear if all Raspberry Pi version can do this, but some might.

So how do I install `openssh` and create the required new host keys,
avoiding the monitor & keyboard?
I want to use a terminal emulator on another host and login into Kali.
I found a cleaver hack for this via this post:
"[Can't ssh in Kali headless setup on Raspberry Pi3][20]".
The solution described is:

1. Take your newly created SD-Card and mount it again via the SD-Card Reader on a box running Linux
2. edit `/<YOUR_MOUNT_POINT>/etc/crontab` and add the following line to the bottom of the file:
`*  *    * * *   root    dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server`.
3. Now unmount the SD-Card, install the SDS_Card in the Raspberry Pi,
attach the RPi to you network via the Ethernet port and boot it up.
4. Cron is going to execute the command `dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server` every minute.
This command will load the SSH package and create the missing host keys.
5. If you wait at least one minute after booting,
you can SSH into you new Kali enabled Raspberry Pi with `ssh -X root@kali` with password `toor`.
6. Soon as you have logged in successfully via ssh,
return and edit `/etc/crontab` again
and to remove the line containing `dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server` previously added.
(Otherwise your RPi keys will be re-created every minute).
7. Reboot the RPi via `shutdown -r now` and log back in via SSH.

>**NOTE:** While using standard login/password authenication is fine on your personal network,
>enabling public key authentication is wise for any public network.
>To do this, edit the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file
>and update to include `PubkeyAuthentication yes` and `PasswordAuthentication no`.
>For more about installing SSH on Kali,

### Step 4: Resize the Linux Partition - DONE
I logged into my Kali/RPi and checked the filesystem:

```bash
# see how disk space is being utilized
$ df -h
Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/root        29G  4.1G   24G  15% /
devtmpfs        460M     0  460M   0% /dev
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /dev/shm
tmpfs           464M  580K  464M   1% /run
tmpfs           5.0M     0  5.0M   0% /run/lock
tmpfs           464M     0  464M   0% /sys/fs/cgroup
tmpfs            93M  4.0K   93M   1% /run/user/112
tmpfs            93M     0   93M   0% /run/user/0
```

Appears that the full root filesystem has claimed
all the available memory on the SD-Card (this is good).
If this is not the case, resize the partition to get access to your entire SD card.
Do the following first:

```bash
# update your packages
apt-get update

# install a disk partition tool (runs long)
apt-get install gparted
```

Now start `gparted` and use this GUI tool to reclaim all the unused space on the SD Card.
[This video][17], and more extensive video [here][18], can help with the details
of the partition update and install of the full Kali Linux.
Now we'll install the full version of Kali Linux.

###  Step 5: Installing Full Version of Kali Linux - DONE
Now you will want to apply updates and upgrades to Kali
and get access to it's full capabilities.
During the installation of the full Version of Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi,
you will be prompted a few times with configuration options.
This post documents those prompts and provides recommendations:
"[Installing Full Version of Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi 3][24]".

```bash
# update and upgrade packages
apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# set the time zone for your raspberry pi device
timedatectl set-timezone "America/New_York"

# install the full version of kali linux (this could take two hours or more)
sudo apt-get install kali-linux-full

# clean up any packages no longer needed
apt-get -y autoremove
```

This install could take well over two hour to run
and consume about 9 Gigabytes of disk space.
With the full version of Kali Linux installed,
you have access to a large range of different tools and programs.
We'll browse through some of them later.

### Step X: Wireless Command & Control (C2) Dongle - RAN INTO DRIVER ISSUES
[How to resolve EW-7811Un built-in driver issues in Linux kernel v3.10 or higher](https://edimax.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/14000035492-how-to-resolve-ew-7811un-built-in-driver-issues-in-linux-kernel-v3-10-or-higher)

The purpose of the C2 wireless dongle is to automatically connect the Pi
to your wireless access point, such as your home network.
This allows remote control of the Pi discreetly or from a great distance via
SSH (Secure Shell) or VNC (Virtual Network Computing).

Device firmwares are not pre-installed in Kali Linux,
so the first step is to load wireless drivers:

```bash
# load wireless drivers; includes all types of wireless devices
apt-get install kali-linux-wireless

# reboot
shutdown -r now
```

Im using the [Edimax EW-7811Un is a Wireless-N dongle][08]
as my C2 connection with my home WiFi network.
To do this, I must edit the interfaces file `/etc/network/interfaces`.
I'll make my C2 the `wlan0` WiFi card by add this block to the file:

```bash
# PLEASE NOTE that this file is written to be used with dhcpcd
# For static IP, consult /etc/dhcpcd.conf and 'man dhcpcd.conf'
# Also see https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/39785/dhcpcd-vs-etc-network-interfaces


# include files from /etc/network/interfaces.d
source-directory /etc/network/interfaces.d

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# establish ethernet (wired) network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

# establish connection to home wifi and other known networks
auto wlan0
allow-hotplug wlan0
iface wlan0 inet dhcp
    wpa-conf /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

Now open the file `/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf` in an editor
and add the following to the bottom of the file so your
Raspberry Pi can connect automatically to your WiFi network:

```bash
# country code environment variable, required for RPi 3
country=US

# path to the ctrl_interface socket and the user group
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev

# allow wpa_supplicant to overwrite configuration file whenever configuration is changed
update_config=1

# 1 = wpa_supplicant initiates scanning and AP selection ; 0 = driver takes care of scanning
ap_scan=1

# home wifi network settings
network={
    id_str="home"                   # needs to match keyword you used in the interfaces file
    ssid="<home-ssid>"              # SSID either as an ASCII string with double quotation or as hex string
    mode=0                          # 0 = managed, 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = access point
    scan_ssid=0                     # = 1 do not broadcast SSID ; = 0 SSID is visible to scans
    proto=WPA RSN                   # list of supported protocals; WPA = WPA ; RSN = WPA2 (also WPA2 is alias for RSN)
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK WPA-EAP        # list of authenticated key management protocols (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, ...)
    psk="<home-password>"           # pre-shared key used in WPA-PSK mode ; 8 to 63 character ASCII passphrase
    pairwise=CCMP                   # accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA (CCMP, TKIP, ...)
    auth_alg=OPEN                   # authentication algorithms (OPEN, ShARED, LEAP, ...)
    priority=3                      # priority of selecting network (larger numbers are higher priority)
}

# jetpack wifi network settings
network={
    id_str="jetpack"                # needs to match keyword you used in the interfaces file
    ssid="<jetpack-ssid>"           # SSID either as an ASCII string with double quotation or as hex string
    mode=0                          # 0 = managed, 1 = ad-hoc, 2 = access point
    scan_ssid=0                     # = 1 do not broadcast SSID ; = 0 SSID is visible to scans
    proto=WPA RSN                   # list of supported protocals; WPA = WPA ; RSN = WPA2 (also WPA2 is alias for RSN)
    key_mgmt=WPA-PSK WPA-EAP        # list of authenticated key management protocols (WPA-PSK, WPA-EAP, ...)
    psk="<jetpack-password>"        # pre-shared key used in WPA-PSK mode ; 8 to 63 character ASCII passphrase
    pairwise=CCMP                   # accepted pairwise (unicast) ciphers for WPA (CCMP, TKIP, ...)
    auth_alg=OPEN                   # authentication algorithms (OPEN, ShARED, LEAP, ...)
    priority=5                      # priority of selecting network (larger numbers are higher priority)
}
```

* `id_str` is used to set up custom network settings, depending on which access point we are connected to
* `scan_ssid` is 1 tells your WiFi adapter to look for the networks automatically and connect when in range
* `ssid` is the name of the wireless network (what you typically see when you search for WiFi connections)
* `psk` is the WiFi password if the network is WPA/WPA2 encrypted, leave out for open or WEP networks
* `proto` could be either RSN (WPA2) or WPA (WPA1)
* `key_mgmt` could be either WPA-PSK (most probably) or WPA-EAP (enterprise networks)
* `pairwise` could be either CCMP (WPA2) or TKIP (WPA1)
* `auth_alg` is most probably OPEN, other options are LEAP and SHARED

Write the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file and
change the read privileges via `chmod go-r /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.

If you want to include other WiFi networks,
just add another `network` structure to the file `etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf`.
(See examples [here][29] and [here][30])

To restart network interface, enter: `sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart`


Now shutdown the RPi (via `shutdown -h now`), unplug your Ethernet connection,
install the Edimax dongle into the RPi USB, and restart the RPi to make sure C2 WiFi is operational.

### Step X: Wireless Attack Dongle
Our attack wireless dongle will be a Kali Linux-compatible WiFi adapter capable of packet injection.
This wireless device will be our attack method onto a WiFi network.

### Step 5: Install WiFi Drivers
For my WiFi radio,
I choose the [Alfa AWUS036ACH][26] with its dual antennas and dual band technology
(2.4 GHz 300 Mbps/5 GHz 867 Mbps) supports 802.11ac and a, b, g, n.
This device has the RTL8812AU wireless chipsets but the drivers are not part of the standard Linux kernel.
Due to popular demand, [the drivers have been modified to allow for injection][04]
The driver can be installed using the following commands:

```bash
# install Alfa AWUS036ACH  /  RTL8812AU wireless chipset drivers
apt-get update
apt-get install realtek-rtl88xxau-dkms
```

Now plug in the adapter, check if its present as a network,
and do a WiFi scan to see if its working via:

```bash
# check if your adaptor is listed
ifconfig

# do a wifi scan to list SSID
iwlist wlan0 scan | grep ESSID
```

>**NOTE:** I did get an error during this install and that error
is documented here: [Kali Linux and RTL8812AU][27].
Everything appears to work but you may want to install from [source on GitHub][28].
This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ0gcA778Ms) could help.

> **NOTE:** The tried and true [Edimax EW-7811Un is a Wireless-N dongle][08]
works very well with the Raspberry Pi and is supports the Kali suite of tools
but doesn't have much gain / range as the Alfa AWUS036ACH.

#### Step X: Remote Desktop into Kali
I want to remote desktop into the Kali Linux so I can take full advantage of the Kali desktop GUI menu system.
There are in fact [many remote desktop software packages][32] available to choose from,
but only small number seem to have any following in the Linux world,
and VNC is the de-facto remote desktop protocol for Linux.
Virtual Network Computing (VNC) uses the RFB (“remote framebuffer”) open protocol.
Because it works at the [framebuffer][32] level, it is applicable to all windowing systems and applications,
including Microsoft Windows, MacOS and the X Window System.
Linux X Window System has its own remote desktop tool, [Xephyr][33],
which allows you to nest X server within a X server (aka "X Nesting").
Cleaver but insecure, little used, an only available on X Window systems
(my experimentation with Xephyr can be found [here][34]).
There are other posibilities for accessing desktops remotely,
such as the [Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)][42].
This is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft,
which provides a user with a graphical interface to
connect to another computer over a network connection.

Because of its popularity, VNC seems like the right choose of protocol.
The [VNC client/server model][38]
moves the whole video frame from the server to the VNCViewer on the client,
which give you a true representation of the remote desktop.
Contrast this with a popular alternative to VNC. that is Windows Remote Desktop (WRD).
WRD does not transport frames, thereby reducing the bandwidth requirements (good),
but instead must create its own separate user session / rendering of the GUI experience (not so good).

There are [multiple instance of VNC implementation][37].
[RealVNC][35] appears to be [supported by Raspberry Pi Raspian OS][36],
on the other hand, [x11vnc][44] seems well tuned for X Windows,
and [TightVNC][39] comes installed within the Kali full distribution package.
But what is the [best VNC][40] ... could it be a useless question?
Just to keep it simple and consistent, I choose to [install TightVNC on my Ubuntu][41] system,
using the installed default VNC on Kali.

In my user scenario for VNC,
my Ubuntu desktop will be running the VNC client so it can run the Kali desktop in one of its window.
Therefore, my Kali Linux will be configured as a VNC server.
The VNCserver software is installed already on Kali but needs to be configured.

##### VNC Install on Ubuntu
So I need to install the TightVNC VNC client on Ubuntu],
but for completeness, I'll do both the client and server:

```bash
# install tightvnc on ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tightvncserver xtightvncviewer
```

To complete the VNC server's initial configuration after installation,
use the `vncserver` command to set up a secure password.

```bash
vncserver
```

You'll be prompted to enter a password, and also a view-only password.
Users who log in with the view-only password will not be able to
control the VNC instance with their mouse or keyboard
(Useful if you want to just demonstrate something to other people using your VNC server).

You may tell our VNC server what commands to perform when it starts up
(generally not needed since I'll be using my Linux desktop as my VNC client).
I want to configure VNC to launch the full Unity desktop when it starts.
These commands are located in a configuration file called `~/.vnc/xstartup`.
Make a backup of the `xstartup` file and then make these modifications:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

# Uncomment the following two lines for normal desktop:
unset SESSION_MANAGER
exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

[ -x /etc/vnc/xstartup ] && exec /etc/vnc/xstartup
[ -r $HOME/.Xresources ] && xrdb $HOME/.Xresources

#xsetroot -solid grey
xsetroot -solid "#DAB082"

vncconfig -iconic &

#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
#x-terminal-emulator &
#x-window-manager &

#gnome-panel &
#gnome-settings-daemon &
#metacity &
#nautilus &
```

The first command in the file, `xrdb $HOME/.Xresources`,
tells VNC's GUI framework to read the server user's `.Xresources` file.
`.Xresources` is where a user can make changes to certain settings of the
graphical desktop, like terminal colors, cursor themes, and font rendering.

When VNC is first set up, it launches a default server instance on port 5901.
This port is called a display port, and is referred to by VNC as `:1`.
VNC can launch multiple instances on other display ports, like :2, :3, etc.
When working with VNC servers, remember that `:X` is a display port that refers to 5900+X.

##### VNC Install on Kali
For VNC to work on the Kali Raspberry Pi,
SSH server must be available and running as installed above.
Now lets install [TightVNC][39]
and the [Autocutsel][45] package to enable cut&paste between client and server:

```bash
# install tughtvnc server and autocutsel packages
apt-get update
apt-get install tightvncserver autocutsel
```

Next we run the VNC server for the first time
to generate configuration files and VNC password.
We will started an X session on display 1, (aka `:1`).
By default, vncserver will attempt to start on display 0 which is already
taken by the started Kali session used for local access
The first time you run vncserver, it prompts for a password.
You'll see that VNC sessions are not linked to Linux user authentication
but relies on a single 8 character password (not very secure):

```bash
# run vnc for first time to genterate configuration files and passwords
root@kali:~# vncserver :1

You will require a password to access your desktops.

Password:
Warning: password truncated to the length of 8.
Verify:
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? y
Password:
Verify:

New 'X' desktop is kali:1

Creating default startup script /root/.vnc/xstartup
Starting applications specified in /root/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /root/.vnc/kali:1.log
```

You can later change that password using the `vncpasswd` command.

We can check the VNCserver is running by issuing the `netstat -tupln | grep tightvnc` command.
You'll find that port 5901 is the VNC connection port, port 6001 is X server for VNC.

```bash
# check if VNC server is running
root@kali:~# netstat -tupln | grep vnc
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:6001            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1350/Xtightvnc
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:5901            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1350/Xtightvnc
```

Now on the VNC client machine (my Linux desktop machine where you install a VNC client `xtightvncviewer`),
you connect to the Kali VNCserver use the command:

```bash
# connect to kali vnc server
xtightvncviewer kali:1

# you can get better performance via
xtightvncviewer kali:1 -compresslevel 9 -quality 4 -depth 8
```

Next lets configure VNC startup script to enable cut and paste.
To do this we edit the file `/root/.vnc/xstartup` as below:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

xrdb $HOME/.Xresources
xsetroot -solid grey
autocutsel -fork

#x-terminal-emulator -geometry 80x24+10+10 -ls -title "$VNCDESKTOP Desktop" &
#x-window-manager &

# Fix to make GNOME work
export XKL_XMODMAP_DISABLE=1
/etc/X11/Xsession
```

You can restart your VNC server and check it is working.

```bash
# restart vnc server
service vncserver restart

# or it this doesn't work
vncserver -kill :1
vncserver :1
```

##### Starting VNC on Kali at Boot Time and Making it More Secure
You may want to enable the VNC when Kali boots up so I can VNC right into it for the GUI.
Otherwise I'll need to first SSH in and turn on the VNC server, as done above.
Also you may be using your Kali outside of your local network
and you'll need run VNC over SSH to make it more secure.
Check out the post ["VNC to access Kali Linux on Raspberry Pi"][46]
and ["How to Configure a VNC Server to Use an SSH Tunnel on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS"][47]
to address these things.

## Personalize Kali Platform
Need to install my personal tools to feel at home.

### Step X: Install Your Personal Tools
Now that all the Linux packages have been loaded,
time to install my "personal tools" that Ihave learned to depend on.

```bash
# execute the pyenv installer (used in .bashrc)
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

# tool to check for window manager (used in .bashrc)
sudo apt-get install wmctrl

# install gnome terminal emulator
sudo apt-get install gnome-terminal

# unlike dpkg, this will fetch all required depencies
apt-get install gdebi -y

# install tools for vim text editor
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.vim.git
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
mkdir ~/.vim/backup
mkdir ~/.vim/tmp

# install tools for bash shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.bash.git
rm .bashrc .bash_logout
ln -s ~/.bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
ln -s ~/.bash/bash_login ~/.bash_login
ln -s ~/.bash/bash_logout ~/.bash_logout
ln -s ~/.bash/bash_profile ~/.bash_profile
ln -s ~/.bash/dircolors.old ~/.dircolors
sudo cp ~/.bash/virtualenvwrapper.sh ~/.bash/virtualenvwrapper_lazy.sh /usr/local/bin
sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper

# install X configuration files
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/jeffskinnerbox/.X.git
ln -s ~/.X/xbindkeysrc ~/.xbindkeysrc
ln -s ~/.X/Xresources ~/.Xresources
ln -s ~/.X/xsessionrc ~/.xsessionrc
```

### Step X: Installing Kali Lazy Script
The [LAZY script][48] is for Kali Linux and
automates many procedures for WiFi penetration and hacking.

```bash
# install lazy script source
cd ~
mkdir src
cd src
git clone https://github.com/arismelachroinos/lscript.git

# install the script
chmod +x install.sh uninstall.sh
./install.sh
```

To run the LAZY script, you sinply execute `/bin/lscript/l`.

You can uninstall LAZY script via

```bash
# uninstall lazy script
cd ~/src//lscript
./uninstall.sh
rmdir -r /root/lscript
```

### Step X: Arpwatch Configuration
check out
cheatsheet-ip-networking-commands.md

### Step X: Post-Install
These are the few things which you may want to perform
after installing a fresh version of Kali Linux.



#### Step X: Privacy with Mozilla's Firefox and Tor Browser
* https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/best-dark-web-websites/

“Out of the box,” Mozilla’s Firefox browser is
[widely regarded as the most privacy-friendly mainstream browser][57] available.
[IceWeasel][56] on Debian Linux, and the GNU version called IceCat,
are free software rebranding of the Mozilla Firefox web browser.
Kali comes with both FireFox and Iceweasel installed,
and while both are very secure,
some security and privacy tweaks need to be done.

[Tor Browser][58] lets you use Tor on Microsoft Windows, Apple MacOS, or GNU/Linux without needing to install any software. It can run off a USB flash drive, comes with a pre-configured web browser to protect your anonymity, and is self-contained (portable).

[Become Anonymous on the Internet Using Tor](https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/become-anonymous-internet-using-tor-0130391/)
1. Download Tor.
1. Install Tor.
1. Navigate to the Data/Vidalia folder, and comment out the Browser line with "#" prefacing it.
1. Run Tor.
1. Users should be using Tor Browser, not installing Torbutton themselves.

* [The Complete Firefox Privacy and Security Guide](https://www.bestvpn.com/firefox-privacy-security-guide/)

#### Step X: Install Tor
You can installing [Tor][53] on Kali Linux and it is available in the Kali repository.
Tor helps hide your traffic from being analyzed by ISPs or the government
It also allows you to access the “Dark Web” which means you can access `.onion` websites.
To read more about Tor, go to [here][54].

[proxychains][55] is a tool that forces any TCP connection made by any given application to follow through proxy like TOR or any other SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP(S) proxy.

To install Tor directly from the Kali repository open your Terminal and type this:

```bash
# install tor
apt-get install tor

# enable tor service
service tor start
or
systemctl enable tor

# browse via tor using proxychains
proxychains iceweasel
```

### Step X: Check the Software and Hardware Version of a Raspberry Pi
For the recorded, let print the hardware and software
information we have for this Raspberry Pi + Kali setup:

```bash
# version of debian you are running
cat /etc/debian_version

# see OS release notes
cat /etc/os-release

# see what kernel version is running
uname -a

# see what hardware you are using
cat /proc/cpuinfo

NOTE: In this example I’ve got a PCB with a Revision code of 0002. That is a plain old “Model B Revision 1.0”.

# raspberry pi model information
cat /proc/device-tree/model

NOTE: The Revision number given in cpuinfo file is the hardware revision number. This is not the same as the Raspberry Pi Rev number sometimes used to descripe updated PCBs. In this example I have a Model B “Rev 1.0” with a hardware revision code of 0002.

# clock speeds can also be discovered using “vcgencmd measure_clock CLOCKNAME” where CLOCKNAME is one of h264, isp, v3d, uart, pwm, emmc, pixel, vec, hdmi, or dpi. he output is in Hertz, so 700000000 is 700MHz.
vcgencmd measure_clock arm

# You can use the following shell script to list all the clock speeds:
for src in arm core h264 isp v3d uart pwm emmc pixel vec hdmi dpi ; do \
echo -e "$src:\t$(vcgencmd measure_clock $src)" ; \
done

# Another “vcgencmd” system command that you might find useful is “vcgencmd measure_volts” to find the internal voltages for core, sdram_c, sdram_i, and sdram_p. For example:
vcgencmd measure_volts core

# The following shell commands will display all the voltages:
for id in core sdram_c sdram_i sdram_p ; do \
echo -e "$id:\t$(vcgencmd measure_volts $id)" ; \
done

# To see how the memory is split between the CPU and the GPU use:
vcgencmd get_mem arm && vcgencmd get_mem gpu

# you core temperature in celcius
/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp

# constantly monitor the core temperature
import os
import time

def measure_temp():
        temp = os.popen("vcgencmd measure_temp").readline()
        return (temp.replace("temp=",""))

while True:
        print(measure_temp())
        time.sleep(1)

# packages loaded
dpkg --get-selections

# show raspberry pi gpu and cpu temperature
cpu=$(</sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp)
echo "$(date) @ $(hostname)"
echo "-------------------------------------------"
echo "GPU => $(/opt/vc/bin/vcgencmd measure_temp)"
echo "CPU => $((cpu/1000))'C"
```

#### Add Standard User
By default, Kali tools only run as the root user.
It is not a good idea to run as root unless it is necessary,
so next we are going to add a standard user account.

```bash
# add pi as a user
useradd -m pi

# set the password for the user account
passwd pi

enable administrator privileges
usermod -a -G sudo pi

# change the default shell to bash
chsh -s /bin/bash pi
```

#### Filezilla
Filezilla is one of the better FTP clients, so install Filezilla using the following command:


```bash
# install the FTP client Filezilla
apt-get install filezilla filezilla-common -y
```

#### HTOP and NetHogs
HTOP shows running process and memory used including many more details than the standard `top`.
NetHogs shows traffic used by applications per interface.
Install them using the following command:

```bash
# install htop and nethogs
apt-get install htop nethogs -y

# you can now run then using the following
htop
nethogs eth0
nethogs wlan0
```

#### Recordmydesktop
Recordmydesktop gives you the ability to record and make a video of your activities in Kali Linux.

```bash
apt-get install gtk-recordmydesktop recordmydesktop -y
```

#### SDR and RTL-SDR
* [Kali Linux 1.0.5 and Software Defined Radio](https://www.kali.org/news/kali-linux-software-defined-radio-support/)

### Step X: Install OpenVAS
The Open Vulnerability Assessment System (OpenVAS) is a framework of several services
and tools offering a comprehensive and powerful vulnerability scanning and vulnerability management solution.

* [OpenVAS](http://www.openvas.org/)

### Step X: Raspberry Pi Disk Encryption
* [Raspberry Pi Disk Encryption](https://docs.kali.org/kali-dojo/04-raspberry-pi-with-luks-disk-encryption)

### Step X: Backup Kali Image via UrBackup
UrBackup is an easy to setup open source client/server backup system, that through a combination of image and file backups accomplishes both data safety and a fast restoration time. File and image backups are made while the system is running without interrupting current processes. UrBackup also continuously watches folders you want backed up in order to quickly find differences to previous backups. Because of that incremental file backups are really fast. Your files can be restored through the web interface or the Windows Explorer while the backups of drive volumes can be restored with a bootable CD or USB-Stick (bare metal restore). A web interface makes setting up your own backup server really easy.

# On Going Maintenance of Kali

## Keeping Kali Up to Date
You can keep Kali up to date with [apt package management][49].

To remove any packages that aren't needed by the system:

```bash
# remove un-needed packaged
sudo apt-get autoremove
```

The typical upgrade commands are:

* `apt-get upgrade` - upgrades all installed packages
* `apt-get dist-upgrade` - same as the above, except its a "smart upgrade".
It does not upgrade from a previous Linux version,
and it will attempt to upgrade the most important packages
at the expense of less important ones if necessary.
* `sudo apt-get clean` clears out the local repository of retrieved package files.
It removes everything but the lock file from
`/var/cache/apt/archives/` and `/var/cache/apt/archives/partial/`.
You'll use this for a major clean-up to get your packages working properly.
The script below show you how to use it
(It can run long but will refreash everything to its the latest
version and remove conflicts).

```bash
# update everything, including the packages, to the most current version
apt-get clean && apt-get update && apt-get upgrade -y && apt-get dist-upgrade -y

# clean up any packages no longer needed
apt-get -y autoremove
```

## Evading Detection
Whenever you visit a website or server over the Internet,
your unique Interpret Protocol (IP) address travels with you.
It would then be very easy to trace the source of an attack by simply tracing the source IP address.
You can evade this detection by using proxies to hide or obscure their IP address.
In this way, they send their traffic to an intermediary proxy,
who then sends the traffic on to the destination,
replacing the source IP address with its own.

There are multiple types of proxies.
One of the more popular, anonymous proxies is Tor.
Although Tor is effective in anonymizing your traffic from Google and other commercial tracking,
it is [not effective in anonymizing your traffic from law enforcement][59], especially the NSA.

**Problems with arwatch.  I couldn't get it to work** - https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/arpwatch/+bug/1655131
## IP/MAC Address Monitoring with with Arpwatch

* [Arpwatch Home Network Monitor](https://www.virtualizationhowto.com/2016/02/arpwatch-home-network-monitor/)

[`aprwatch`][74] is an open source computer software that is used for
monitoring Address Resolution Protocol (APR) traffic on a computer network.
With `aprwatch`, you can easily keep a log or database of all Ethernet and IP address pairings.
That is, a list of all identified IP and MAC addresses pairings and their corresponding timestamps.
`aprwatch` listen to APR packets on a local network to monitor ARP activity to detect
ARP spoofing, network flip-flops, changed and new stations and address reuse.
It also has the option of reporting these changes via email.
To install `arpwatch` on Debian/Ubuntu Based Distros, do `sudo apt-get install arpwatch`.

`apwatch` creates or uses some important files for its operation.
The locations may vary a bit depending on the distro,
but for Ubuntu / Debian, you'll find the following:

* `/var/lib/arpwatch` - default directory
* `/var/lib/arpwatch/arp.dat` - main ethernet/ip address records database
* `/var/lib/arpwatch/ethercodes.dat` - vendor ethernet block list
* `/etc/rc.d/init.d/arpwatch` - arpwatch service to start or stop daemon
* `/etc/sysconfig/arpwatch` - main configuration file
* `/usr/sbin/arpwatch` - binary command to start and stop tool using the terminal
* `/var/log/messages` - system log file where arpwatch writes any changes or unusual activity to IP/MAC

After an install, you'll find that `arpwatch` isn't running (check via `ps –ef | grep arpwatch`).
To get `arwatch` going, you need to first configure it.
First create `/etc/arpwatch.conf`
and insert line like this: `eth0 -a -n 192.168.1.0/24 -m jeff.irland@verizon.net`.

Now restart `arpwatch` for trhis new configuration:
and check if the process is running:

```bash
# restart arpwatch process
/etc/init.d/arpwatch restart

# check to assure process is running
ps -aux | grep arpwatch
```

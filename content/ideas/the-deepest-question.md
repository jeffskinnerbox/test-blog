What the hell is going on?

In 1960, [Eugene Wigner][01]
published a now classic article on the philosophy of mathematics and of physics,
"[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences][02]"
(reprint of the original article [here][03])

# Philosophy
It may be wise to learn a little more about philosophy to truly appreciate and master the topics below.
Philosophy is the systematic and critical study of fundamental questions that arise
about existence, logic, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
The philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument, and systematic presentation.

So [what is Philosophy][04], [why do you need to know about it][05], [is it at all useful][06],
and  after all, [isn't it dead][07]?

# Paradoxes of Infinity
A **paradox** is a seemingly absurd or self-contradictory statement or proposition
that when investigated or explained may prove to be well founded or true.
